## Introduction

Welcome to the world of Aspose.3D for .NET, a powerful library that empowers developers to work seamlessly with 3D scenes and models in their .NET applications. In this tutorial, we will delve into the intricacies of understanding node hierarchy in 3D scenes using Aspose.3D. By the end of this guide, you will have a solid grasp of how to manipulate the structure of 3D scenes through nodes, enabling you to create stunning visual experiences.

## Prerequisites

Before we embark on this 3D journey, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Aspose.3D for .NET Library: Ensure that you have the Aspose.3D library integrated into your .NET project. If you haven't done this yet, head over to the [documentation](https://reference.aspose.com/3d/net/) for guidance.

- Download the Library: If you haven't downloaded the Aspose.3D library, grab the latest version from the [download link](https://releases.aspose.com/3d/net/) and follow the installation instructions provided in the documentation.

- Get a License: To unlock the full potential of Aspose.3D, you need a valid license. If you don't have one, you can obtain it [here](https://purchase.aspose.com/buy) or opt for a [free trial](https://releases.aspose.com/) to explore its capabilities.

- Support and Community: Join the Aspose.3D community on the [support forum](https://forum.aspose.com/c/3d/18) to connect with other developers, seek help, and stay updated on the latest developments.

- Temporary License (Optional): If you're exploring Aspose.3D before making a purchase, consider obtaining a [temporary license](https://purchase.aspose.com/temporary-license/) for extended access.

Now that we have our tools ready, let's dive into the exciting world of 3D node hierarchy manipulation using Aspose.3D.

## Import Namespaces

In your .NET project, ensure you import the necessary namespaces to leverage the functionality provided by Aspose.3D. Add the following lines to your code:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.IO;
using Aspose.ThreeD;
using Aspose.ThreeD.Entities;
using Aspose.ThreeD.Utilities;
```

These namespaces will give you access to essential classes and methods for working with 3D scenes.

## Step 1: Initialize Scene Object

```csharp
Scene scene = new Scene();
```

Begin by creating a new 3D scene using the `Scene` class.

## Step 2: Create Child Nodes

```csharp
Node top = scene.RootNode.CreateChildNode();
Node cube1 = top.CreateChildNode("cube1");
Node cube2 = top.CreateChildNode("cube2");
```

Establish a hierarchical structure by creating parent-child relationships between nodes. In this example, `cube1` and `cube2` are child nodes of the `top` node.

## Step 3: Create and Assign Mesh

```csharp
Mesh mesh = Common.CreateMeshUsingPolygonBuilder();
cube1.Entity = mesh;
cube2.Entity = mesh;
```

Generate a mesh using a suitable method (here, `CreateMeshUsingPolygonBuilder`) and assign it to the child nodes.

## Step 4: Set Translations

```csharp
cube1.Transform.Translation = new Vector3(-10, 0, 0);
cube2.Transform.Translation = new Vector3(10, 0, 0);
```

Define translations for each cube node, positioning them in the 3D space.

## Step 5: Apply Rotation to Parent Node

```csharp
top.Transform.Rotation = Quaternion.FromEulerAngle(Math.PI, 4, 0);
```

Rotate the parent node (`top`), and observe how this transformation affects all its child nodes.

## Step 6: Save the 3D Scene

```csharp
string output = "Your Output Directory" + "NodeHierarchy.fbx";
scene.Save(output, FileFormat.FBX7500ASCII);
```

Specify the output directory and save the 3D scene in the desired file format (here, FBX7500ASCII).

## Step 7: Display Success Message

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("\nNode hierarchy added successfully to document.\nFile saved at " + output);
```

Inform the user about the successful addition of the node hierarchy and the saved file location.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully navigated the intricate world of 3D node hierarchy in Aspose.3D for .NET. This tutorial has equipped you with the knowledge to create, manipulate, and save 3D scenes with ease. As you continue your journey, explore more features and unleash the full potential of Aspose.3D in your .NET projects.
