## Introduction

Welcome to this comprehensive tutorial on transforming nodes by Euler angles in 3D scenes using Aspose.3D for .NET. In this guide, we'll delve into the exciting world of 3D graphics and explore the process of adding transformations to a node using Euler angles. Aspose.3D for .NET provides powerful tools for working with 3D scenes and meshes, making it an excellent choice for developers seeking versatility and efficiency in their projects.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Aspose.3D for .NET Library: Ensure that you have the Aspose.3D library installed. You can download it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/3d/net/).

- Development Environment: Set up your preferred .NET development environment, such as Visual Studio.

## Import Namespaces

Begin by importing the necessary namespaces to access the functionality provided by Aspose.3D for .NET:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.IO;
using Aspose.ThreeD;
using Aspose.ThreeD.Entities;
using Aspose.ThreeD.Utilities;
```

Now, let's break down the example into multiple steps for a clear understanding.

## Step 1: Initialize Scene Object

```csharp
// ExStart:AddTransformationToNodeByEulerAngles
// Initialize scene object
Scene scene = new Scene();
```

Start by creating a new 3D scene using the `Scene` class.

## Step 2: Initialize Node Class Object

```csharp
// Initialize Node class object
Node cubeNode = new Node("cube");
```

Create a node within the scene using the `Node` class. This node will serve as the container for our 3D object.

## Step 3: Create Mesh Using Polygon Builder

```csharp
// Call Common class create mesh using polygon builder method to set mesh instance 
Mesh mesh = Common.CreateMeshUsingPolygonBuilder(); 
```

Invoke a method (in this case, `CreateMeshUsingPolygonBuilder` from a custom `Common` class) to generate a mesh for the 3D object.

## Step 4: Point Node to the Mesh Geometry

```csharp
// Point node to the Mesh geometry
cubeNode.Entity = mesh;
```

Associate the created mesh with the node.

## Step 5: Set Euler Angles and Translation

```csharp
// Euler angles
cubeNode.Transform.EulerAngles = new Vector3(0.3, 0.1, -0.5);            
// Set translation
cubeNode.Transform.Translation = new Vector3(0, 0, 20);
```

Define the Euler angles and translation for the node to position it in the 3D space.

## Step 6: Add Cube to the Scene

```csharp
// Add cube to the scene
scene.RootNode.ChildNodes.Add(cubeNode);
```

Incorporate the node into the scene's hierarchy.

## Step 7: Save the 3D Scene

```csharp
// The path to the documents directory.
var output = "Your Output Directory" + "TransformationToNode.fbx";

// Save 3D scene in the supported file formats
scene.Save(output, FileFormat.FBX7500ASCII);
// ExEnd:AddTransformationToNodeByEulerAngles
Console.WriteLine("\nTransformation added successfully to node.\nFile saved at " + output);
```

Specify the output directory and save the 3D scene, including the transformed node, in the desired file format (FBX7500ASCII in this case).

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully learned how to transform a node by Euler angles in 3D scenes using Aspose.3D for .NET. This powerful library opens the door to endless possibilities in 3D graphics development.
