## Introduction

Welcome to this comprehensive tutorial on merging objects into a grid using Aspose.3D for .NET! If you are a developer or 3D enthusiast looking to improve your 3D modeling skills, you have come to the right place. This tutorial will guide you step-by-step through the entire process, ensuring a smooth learning experience.

## Prerequisites

Before we embark on this 3D journey, let's ensure you have everything you need:

1. Aspose.3D for .NET Library: Download and install the library from the [Aspose documentation](https://reference.aspose.com/3d/net/).

2. Development Environment: Set up your preferred .NET development environment.

3. Basic Familiarity with C#: This tutorial assumes you have a basic understanding of C# programming.

## Import Namespaces

Now, let's kick things off by importing the necessary namespaces in your C# code:

```csharp
using System;
using Aspose.ThreeD;
using Aspose.ThreeD.Entities;
```

## Step 1: Initialize the Scene and Input file

Input file into the scene:

```csharp
//Input file may contains multiple objects
var scene = Scene.FromFile("input.fbx");
```

## Step 2: Merge mesh

Now, let's merge them into a single mesh:

```csharp
//now merge them into a single mesh
Mesh merged = PolygonModifier.MergeMesh(scene);
```

## Step 3: Save files

We need to save this to a file with only one mesh:

```csharp
//then we save it to a file with only one mesh
var newScene = new Scene(merged);
newScene.Save("test.obj");
```
