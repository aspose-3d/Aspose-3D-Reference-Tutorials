## Introduction

Welcome to the exciting world of 3D modeling with Aspose.3D for .NET! In this comprehensive tutorial, we'll explore step-by-step the process of creating a 3D mesh from text using specified font files. Whether you're an experienced developer or a curious beginner, in this tutorial we'll delve into the process step by step using clear examples and detailed explanations. By the end you will have an in-depth understanding of how to create 3D meshes from text.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the tutorial, ensure you have the following:
- Basic understanding of C# and .NET programming.
- Aspose.3D for .NET library installed. You can download it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/3d/net/).
- A development environment set up for .NET programming.

## Import Namespaces

In your .NET project, begin by importing the necessary namespaces:

```csharp
using System;
using Aspose.ThreeD;
using Aspose.ThreeD.Entities;
using Aspose.ThreeD.Shading;
using Aspose.ThreeD.Profiles;
using Aspose.ThreeD.Utilities;
```

These namespaces provide the essential classes and methods for working with 3D scenes in Aspose.3D.

## Step 1: Get font

```csharp
// Get font from font file
var font = FontFile.FromFile(@"CascadiaCode-Regular.otf");
```

This code gets the font from your font file.

## Step 2: Set text profile

```csharp
// Create a text profile
var text = new Text();
text.Font = font;
text.Content = "ABC";
text.FontSize = 10;
```

Here we create the text profile, set the font of the text, the content of the text and the font size of the text.

## Step 3: Create mesh from text

```csharp
// Create mesh from text, create a scene using the mesh and save it
var linear = new LinearExtrusion(text, 10).ToMesh();
var scene = new Scene(linear);
scene.Save(@"test.stl");
```

Here we covered how to create a 3D mesh from text, and how to create a scene with the mesh and save it.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have successfully learned how to create a 3D mesh from text using Aspose.3D for .NET using a specified font file. Feel free to experiment and incorporate this knowledge into your projects.
