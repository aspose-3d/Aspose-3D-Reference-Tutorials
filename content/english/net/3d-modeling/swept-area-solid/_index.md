## Introduction

Welcome to this comprehensive guide to solid modeling using sweep regions in 3D scenes using Aspose.3D for .NET. If you're a developer or 3D enthusiast looking to improve your skills, you've come to the right place. In this tutorial, we'll delve into the process step by step using clear examples and detailed explanations.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the tutorial, ensure you have the following:
- Basic understanding of C# and .NET programming.
- Aspose.3D for .NET library installed. You can download it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/3d/net/).
- A development environment set up for .NET programming.

## Import Namespaces

In your .NET project, begin by importing the necessary namespaces:

```csharp
using System;
using Aspose.ThreeD.Entities;
using Aspose.ThreeD.Profiles;
using Aspose.ThreeD;
```

These namespaces provide the essential classes and methods for working with 3D scenes in Aspose.3D.

## Step 1: Create Circle and CShape

```csharp
// Create Circle
var directrix = new Circle(20);

// Create CShape
var shape = new CShape();
```

This code means create circle and CShape.

## Step 2: Sweep a C-shape on a circle to model a solid

```csharp
// Create a SweptAreaSolid instance
var swept = new SweptAreaSolid()
{
    Shape = shape,
    Directrix = directrix,
    StartPoint = EndPoint.FromDegree(0),
    EndPoint = EndPoint.FromDegree(130)
};
```

Here we create a SweptAreaSolid object and model a solid by sweeping a C-shape over a circle.

## Step 3: Initialize scene objects and save them in obj format

```csharp
// Add the object to the scene and save it in obj format
var scene = new Scene();
scene.RootNode.CreateChildNode(swept);
scene.Save("swept.obj");
```

Save the scene to an OBJ file in the specified data directory.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have successfully learned how to use Aspose.3D for .NET to model a solid by sweeping a C-shape on a circle. Feel free to experiment and incorporate this knowledge into your projects.
