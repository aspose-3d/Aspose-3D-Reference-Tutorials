## Introduction

Welcome to a comprehensive guide to modeling solids using revolved area. If you're a developer or 3D enthusiast looking to improve your skills, you've come to the right place. In this tutorial, we'll walk you through the process step by step using clear explanations and code snippets. Finally, you'll have a solid understanding of how to use revolved area solid modeling.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the tutorial, ensure you have the following:
- Basic understanding of C# and .NET programming.
- Aspose.3D for .NET library installed. You can download it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/3d/net/).
- A development environment set up for .NET programming.

## Import Namespaces

In your .NET project, begin by importing the necessary namespaces:

```csharp
using Aspose.ThreeD;
using Aspose.ThreeD.Entities;
using Aspose.ThreeD.Utilities;
using Aspose.ThreeD.Profiles;
```

These namespaces provide the essential classes and methods for working with 3D scenes in Aspose.3D.

## Step 1: Initialize the Scene Object

```csharp
//Create a new 3D scene
Scene scene = new Scene();
```

This code sets up the environment for your 3D scene.

## Step 2: Set the base profile to be revolved

```csharp
// Initialize the base profile to be revolved
var profile = new RectangleShape()
{
    RoundingRadius = 0.3
};
```

Here we will initialize the 'RectangleShape' and set the fillet radius value.

## Step 3: Create a RevolvedAreaSolid instance and save it in obj format

```csharp
//create a RevolvedAreaSolid instance 
var revolved = new RevolvedAreaSolid()
{
    Shape = profile,
    Origin = new Vector3(1, 0, 0),
    AngleStart = 0,
    AngleEnd = Math.PI
};
scene.RootNode.CreateChildNode(revolved);

scene.Save("revolved.obj");
```

Save the scene to an OBJ file in the specified data directory.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have successfully learned how to model solids by revolved area using Aspose.3D for .NET. Feel free to experiment and incorporate this knowledge into your projects.
