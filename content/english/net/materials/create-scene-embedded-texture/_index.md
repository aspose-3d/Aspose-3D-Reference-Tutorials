## Introduction
Welcome to the exciting world of 3D graphics with Aspose.3D for .NET! In this comprehensive tutorial, we will guide you through the process of creating stunning 3D scenes with embedded textures using Aspose.3D, a powerful and versatile library for .NET developers.
## Prerequisites
Before diving into the tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:
- A basic understanding of C# and .NET programming.
- Visual Studio installed on your machine.
- Aspose.3D for .NET library, which you can download [here](https://releases.aspose.com/3d/net/).
- Familiarity with the concepts of 3D graphics and scene creation.
## Import Namespaces
Start by importing the necessary namespaces into your project. These namespaces will provide you with the tools and functionalities required for 3D graphics manipulation.
```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Drawing;
using System.Drawing.Drawing2D;
using System.Drawing.Imaging;
using System.IO;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Aspose.ThreeD;
using Aspose.ThreeD.Entities;
using Aspose.ThreeD.Shading;
```
## Step 1: Creating a Scene
Begin by creating a new 3D scene using Aspose.3D for .NET. This will serve as the canvas for your 3D masterpiece.
```csharp
// Create a FBX file with embedded textures
Scene scene = new Scene();
```
## Step 2: Creating an Embedded Texture
Now, let's add some visual flair to your scene by embedding a texture. We'll create a texture with custom content and assign it a filename.
```csharp
// Create an embedded texture
Texture tex = new Texture()
{
    Content = CreateTextureContent(),
    // File name is required if the embedded texture is used.
    FileName = "test.png"
};
tex.SetProperty("TexProp", "value");
```
## Step 3: Creating a Material
Next, create a material for your 3D objects, incorporating the previously created texture and custom properties.
```csharp
// Create a material with custom property
LambertMaterial mat = new LambertMaterial("my-mat");
mat.SetTexture(Material.MapDiffuse, tex);
mat.SetProperty("MyProp", 1.0);
```
## Step 4: Creating a 3D Object
Now, let's bring your scene to life by adding a 3D object. In this example, we'll use a torus and apply the material you just created.
```csharp
// Create a torus with the previously created material applied
scene.RootNode.CreateChildNode(new Torus()).Material = mat;
```
## Step 5: Saving the Scene
Finally, save your masterpiece to a file. In this example, we'll save it in FBX format.
```csharp
// Save the scene to a file
scene.Save(RunExamples.GetOutputFilePath(@"test.fbx"), FileFormat.FBX7500ASCII);
```
Congratulations! You've successfully created a 3D scene with embedded textures using Aspose.3D for .NET.
## CreateTextureContent Source Code
```csharp
        private static byte[] CreateTextureContent()
        {
            using (var bitmap = new Bitmap(256, 256))
            {
                using (var g = Graphics.FromImage(bitmap))
                {
                    g.Clear(Color.White);
                    LinearGradientBrush brush = new LinearGradientBrush(new Rectangle(0, 0, 128, 128), Color.Moccasin,
                        Color.ForestGreen, 45);
                    using (var font = new Font(FontFamily.GenericSerif, 40))
                    {
                        g.DrawString("Aspose.3D", font, brush, Point.Empty);
                    }
                }
                using (var ms = new MemoryStream())
                {
                    bitmap.Save(ms, ImageFormat.Png);
                    return ms.ToArray();
                }
            }
        }
```
