## Introduction
Welcome to the world of 3D modeling with Aspose.3D for .NET! In this tutorial, we will explore the powerful capabilities of Aspose.3D and guide you through creating stunning 3D models effortlessly. Whether you're a seasoned developer or a beginner looking to delve into the world of 3D modeling, this tutorial is designed to make the process seamless and enjoyable.
## Prerequisites
Before we dive into the exciting world of 3D modeling using Aspose.3D for .NET, let's make sure you have the necessary prerequisites in place:
1. Install Aspose.3D for .NET: Begin by downloading and installing Aspose.3D for .NET from the [download link](https://releases.aspose.com/3d/net/). Follow the installation instructions provided to set up the library in your development environment.
2. Access Documentation: Familiarize yourself with the library's documentation available at [Aspose.3D for .NET Documentation](https://reference.aspose.com/3d/net/). This resource will be your guide throughout the tutorial.
3. Get a Temporary License: If you don't have a license yet, grab a temporary one from [here](https://purchase.aspose.com/temporary-license/) to explore the full potential of Aspose.3D during this tutorial.
## Import Namespaces
Now that you have the prerequisites in place, let's start by importing the necessary namespaces for your project. This step is crucial for accessing the functionalities provided by Aspose.3D.
## Step 1: Import Aspose.3D Namespace
In your project, add the following namespace to enable the use of Aspose.3D:
```csharp
using Aspose.ThreeD;
using Aspose.ThreeD.Entities;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
```
## Step 2: Import Additional Required Namespaces
Depending on your specific needs, you may need to import additional namespaces. For example, when working with 3D primitives like spheres, include the following:
```csharp
using Aspose.ThreeD.Entities;
```
## Working with Sphere Radius
Now, let's dive into creating a 3D model – a sphere – using Aspose.3D for .NET. We'll break down the process into easy-to-follow steps.
## Step 1: Create a Scene
Begin by creating a new 3D scene using the following code snippet:
```csharp
Scene scene = new Scene();
```
## Step 2: Set Sphere Radius
Now, let's add a sphere to our scene and set its radius. This is done using the `Radius` property.
```csharp
scene.RootNode.CreateChildNode(new Sphere() { Radius = 10 });
```
## Step 3: Save the Scene
Once you've set up your 3D model, save the scene to your desired location and file format. In this example, we're saving it as a Wavefront OBJ file.
```csharp
scene.Save("Your Document Directory" + "sphere.obj", FileFormat.WavefrontOBJ);
```
Congratulations! You've successfully created a 3D model of a sphere using Aspose.3D for .NET. Feel free to explore further and experiment with different parameters to unleash your creativity.
