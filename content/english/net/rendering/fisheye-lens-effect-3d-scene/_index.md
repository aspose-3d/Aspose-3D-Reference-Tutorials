## Introduction
Are you looking to enhance the visual appeal of your 3D scenes? Dive into the fascinating world of fisheye lens effects with Aspose.3D for .NET. This tutorial will guide you step by step on how to apply a fisheye lens effect to your 3D scenes, giving them a unique and captivating perspective.
## Prerequisites
Before we begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:
- Aspose.3D for .NET: Ensure that you have the Aspose.3D library for .NET installed. If not, you can download it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/3d/net/).
- Sample 3D Scene: We'll be working with a sample 3D scene file (VirtualCity.glb). You can use your own scene or download the sample from the [Aspose.3D documentation](https://reference.aspose.com/3d/net/).
## Import Namespaces
In your .NET project, include the necessary namespaces to access the Aspose.3D functionalities. Add the following namespaces at the beginning of your code:
```csharp
using Aspose.ThreeD;
using Aspose.ThreeD.Entities;
using Aspose.ThreeD.Render;
using Aspose.ThreeD.Utilities;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Drawing;
using System.Drawing.Imaging;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
```
## Step 1: Load the 3D Scene
Load the 3D scene file into your project using the following code:
```csharp
Scene scene = new Scene(RunExamples.GetDataFilePath("VirtualCity.glb"));
```
## Step 2: Set Up Camera and Lights
Create a camera and lights to enhance the visual aspects of your scene. Adjust parameters like NearPlane, FarPlane, and RotationMode as needed:
```csharp
Camera cam = new Camera(ProjectionType.Perspective)
{
    NearPlane = 0.1,
    FarPlane = 200,
    RotationMode = RotationMode.FixedDirection
};
scene.RootNode.CreateChildNode(cam).Transform.Translation = new Vector3(5, 6, 0);
scene.RootNode.CreateChildNode(new Light() { LightType = LightType.Point }).Transform.Translation = new Vector3(-10, 7, -10);
scene.RootNode.CreateChildNode(new Light() { Color = new Vector3(Color.CadetBlue) }).Transform.Translation = new Vector3(49, 0, 49);
```
## Step 3: Create Renderer and Render Targets
Set up the renderer and create render targets for cube map and 2D texture:
```csharp
using (var renderer = Renderer.CreateRenderer())
{
    IRenderTexture rt = renderer.RenderFactory.CreateCubeRenderTexture(new RenderParameters(false), 512, 512);
    IRenderTexture final = renderer.RenderFactory.CreateRenderTexture(new RenderParameters(false, 32, 0, 0), 1024, 1024);
    rt.CreateViewport(cam, RelativeRectangle.FromScale(0, 0, 1, 1));
    renderer.Render(rt);
```
## Step 4: Apply Fisheye Lens Effect
Execute the fisheye lens effect post-processing on the rendered cube map:
```csharp
PostProcessing fisheye = renderer.GetPostProcessing("fisheye");
fisheye.FindProperty("fov").Value = 360.0;
fisheye.Input = rt.Targets[0];
renderer.Execute(fisheye, final);
((ITexture2D)final.Targets[0]).Save("Your Output Directory" + "fisheye.png", ImageFormat.Png);
```
## Conclusion
Congratulations! You've successfully applied a fisheye lens effect to your 3D scene using Aspose.3D for .NET. Experiment with different scenes and parameters to unleash your creativity.
## Frequently Asked Questions
### Can I apply the fisheye effect to any 3D scene?
Yes, you can apply the fisheye effect to any 3D scene. Ensure that the scene is properly loaded and lit for optimal results.
### What is the significance of adjusting the field of view (fov) to 360 degrees?
A field of view of 360 degrees ensures a complete spherical projection, creating a stunning fisheye effect.
### How can I customize the lighting in my 3D scene?
You can adjust the properties of the lights, such as position, type, and color, to achieve the desired lighting effects.
### Is there a limit to the size of the 3D scene that can be processed?
The size of the 3D scene is primarily limited by system resources. Ensure that your hardware can handle the size of your scene.
### Can I use a different output format instead of PNG for the fisheye effect result?
Yes, you can modify the code to save the output in different image formats based on your requirements.
