## Introduction

Welcome to the world of Aspose.3D for .NET! If you're looking to enhance your 3D development capabilities, you're in the right place. In this tutorial, we'll dive into the Loading and Saving functionalities, specifically focusing on Custom Save Options. Aspose.3D for .NET is a powerful library that empowers developers to manipulate and save 3D scenes efficiently.

## Prerequisites

Before we start exploring the exciting features of Aspose.3D, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- Basic understanding of C# and .NET development.
- Aspose.3D for .NET library installed. You can download it from the [release page](https://releases.aspose.com/3d/net/).
- A development environment set up with Visual Studio or any other preferred C# IDE.

## Import Namespaces

To get started, let's import the necessary namespaces:

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Collections;
using Aspose.ThreeD;
using Aspose.ThreeD.Formats;
using Aspose.ThreeD.Entities;
using Aspose.ThreeD.Utilities;
using Aspose.ThreeD.Shading;
using System.Drawing;
```

Now that we've set the stage let's break down the tutorial into multiple steps.

## Step 1: Collada Save Option

Let's begin with Collada, a popular 3D file format. Follow these steps to customize Collada saving options:

### 1. Set Up Directory:
   ```csharp
   string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
   ```

### 2. Initialize Collada Save Options:
   ```csharp
   ColladaSaveOptions saveColladaOpts = new ColladaSaveOptions();
   ```

### 3. Configure Options:
   ```csharp
   saveColladaOpts.Indented = true;
   saveColladaOpts.TransformStyle = ColladaTransformStyle.Matrix;
   saveColladaOpts.LookupPaths = new List<string>(new string[] { dataDir });
   ```

## Step 2: Discreet 3DS Save Option

Now, let's explore Discreet 3DS and its customization options:

### 1. Set Up Directory:
   ```csharp
   string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
   ```

### 2. Initialize 3DS Save Options:
   ```csharp
   Discreet3dsSaveOptions saveOpts = new Discreet3dsSaveOptions();
   ```

### 3. Configure Options:
   ```csharp
   saveOpts.DuplicatedNameCounterBase = 2;
   // Additional configuration options...
   ```

Continue this step-by-step approach for FBX, OBJ, STL, U3D, glTF, and DRC save options, customizing each according to your requirements.

## Step 3: glTF Save Options

Now, let's focus on glTF, a format widely used in web and mobile applications. Customize your glTF save options with these steps:

### 1. Initialize Scene Object:
   ```csharp
   Scene scene = new Scene();
   scene.RootNode.CreateChildNode("sphere", new Sphere());
   ```

### 2. Set glTF Saving Options:
   ```csharp
   GltfSaveOptions opt = new GltfSaveOptions(FileContentType.ASCII);
   opt.EmbedAssets = true;
   opt.UseCommonMaterials = true;
   opt.BufferFile = "mybuf.bin";
   ```

### 3. Save glTF File:
   ```csharp
   scene.Save("Your Output Directory" + "glTFSaveOptions_out.gltf", opt);
   ```

Follow a similar structure for other save options such as DRC and RVM.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully explored the custom save options in Aspose.3D for .NET. This powerful library provides a myriad of options to tailor your 3D scene saving process.
