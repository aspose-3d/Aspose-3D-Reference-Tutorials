## Introduction

Welcome to our comprehensive guide on leveraging the capabilities of Aspose.3D for .NET to enhance your 3D modeling and manipulation tasks. Aspose.3D is a robust API that allows developers to work seamlessly with 3D file formats in their .NET applications. In this tutorial, we'll focus on the vital aspect of loading and saving, specifically opening a scene from a protected PDF using Aspose.3D for .NET.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the tutorial, ensure that you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Basic knowledge of .NET development.
- Aspose.3D for .NET library installed. You can download it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/3d/net/).
- Access to a protected PDF file for testing purposes.
- A text editor or an integrated development environment (IDE) for coding.

Now that we're ready, let's get started!

## Import Namespaces

In your .NET project, begin by importing the necessary namespaces to enable the use of Aspose.3D functionalities. Add the following namespaces at the beginning of your code:

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using System.Text;
using System.Collections;
using Aspose.ThreeD;
using Aspose.ThreeD.Formats;
```

## Loading and Saving - Opening Scene from Protected PDF

### Step 1: Create a new scene

To kick things off, initialize a new scene using the following code snippet:

```csharp
// ExStart:OpenSceneFromProtectedPdf
// Create a new scene
Scene scene = new Scene();
// ExEnd:OpenSceneFromProtectedPdf
```

### Step 2: Loading options and applying password

Now, set up loading options and apply the password for the protected PDF. This ensures secure access to the PDF file:

```csharp
// ExStart:OpenSceneFromProtectedPdf
PdfLoadOptions opt = new PdfLoadOptions() { Password = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes("password") };
// ExEnd:OpenSceneFromProtectedPdf
```

### Step 3: Open the scene from the PDF file

Use the loaded options to open the scene from the protected PDF:

```csharp
// ExStart:OpenSceneFromProtectedPdf
scene.Open(RunExamples.GetDataFilePath("House_Design.pdf"), opt);
// ExEnd:OpenSceneFromProtectedPdf
```

By following these steps, you've successfully loaded a 3D scene from a protected PDF using Aspose.3D for .NET.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, Aspose.3D for .NET provides a powerful set of tools to manipulate 3D scenes effortlessly. This tutorial focused on loading a scene from a protected PDF, showcasing the versatility and security features of the Aspose.3D API.
