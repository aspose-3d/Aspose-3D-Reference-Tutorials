Scene scene = new Scene();
scene.Open(RunExamples.GetDataFilePath("document.fbx"));
// ExEnd:Load3DFile
```

### Step 2: Detect the Format

```csharp
// ExStart:DetectFormat
// Detect the format of a 3D file
FileFormat inputFormat = FileFormat.Detect(RunExamples.GetDataFilePath("document.fbx"));
// Display the file format
Console.WriteLine("File Format: " + inputFormat.ToString());
// ExEnd:DetectFormat
```

### Step 3: Save the 3D File

```csharp
// ExStart:Save3DFile
scene.Save("output.fbx", FileFormat.FBX7500ASCII);
