## Introduction:

Embark on a thrilling journey into the realm of 3D graphics with Aspose.3D for .NET, a powerhouse that elevates your development game. In this tutorial, we will delve into the intricacies of Linear Extrusion – a fascinating technique that breathes life into static 2D profiles, propelling them into the dynamic world of 3D. Let’s unlock the door to creativity and innovation using Aspose.3D!

## Prerequisites:

Before diving into the enchanting world of 3D manipulation, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. Aspose.3D Installation:
   - Begin by downloading and installing Aspose.3D for .NET from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/3d/net/).
   - Follow the installation instructions provided in the documentation [here](https://reference.aspose.com/3d/net/).

2. Setting Up Your Development Environment:
   - Ensure that your development environment is configured correctly with the required namespaces for Aspose.3D.

Now that you are geared up, let’s jump into the magic of Aspose.3D!

## Import Namespaces:

Include the essential namespaces to kickstart your 3D adventure:

```csharp
using Aspose.ThreeD;
using Aspose.ThreeD.Entities;
using Aspose.ThreeD.Profiles;
using Aspose.ThreeD.Utilities;
```

These namespaces lay the foundation for your 3D coding journey, providing access to the tools needed for seamless integration of Aspose.3D functionalities.

## Performing Linear Extrusion:

Let's create a mesmerizing 3D object through Linear Extrusion using Aspose.3D. Follow these steps:

## Step 1: Initialize the Base Profile
```csharp
var profile = new RectangleShape()
{
    RoundingRadius = 0.3
};
```

This step sets up the 2D profile that will serve as the foundation for our 3D masterpiece. Adjust the parameters as needed to achieve the desired shape and form.

## Step 2: Linear Extrusion
```csharp
var extrusion = new LinearExtrusion(profile, 10) { Slices = 100, Center = true, Twist = 360, TwistOffset = new Vector3(10, 0, 0) };
```

Here, the Linear Extrusion is performed, taking the 2D profile and extending it in the third dimension. Experiment with parameters like 'Slices' and 'Twist' to mold your creation.

## Step 3: Create a Scene
```csharp
Scene scene = new Scene();
```

A blank canvas is created – a scene where your 3D object will come to life.

## Step 4: Add Extrusion to the Scene
```csharp
scene.RootNode.CreateChildNode(extrusion);
```

Your extruded masterpiece is added as a child node to the scene.

## Step 5: Save the 3D Scene
```csharp
scene.Save(RunExamples.GetOutputFilePath("LinearExtrusion.obj"), FileFormat.WavefrontOBJ);
```

Finally, save your creation in the desired format. In this example, it's saved as a Wavefront OBJ file.

Now, behold your 3D marvel!

## Conclusion:

Congratulations! You've just scratched the surface of Aspose.3D's potential. This tutorial merely hints at the vast landscape waiting for your exploration. Dive into the documentation, experiment with various shapes, and unlock the full spectrum of possibilities with Aspose.3D for .NET.
