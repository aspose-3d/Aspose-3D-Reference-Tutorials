## Introduction

Welcome to the world of Aspose.3D for .NET, a versatile library empowering developers to handle 3D manipulation with ease. In this tutorial, we will delve into one of the intriguing features - the "Twist Offset in Linear Extrusion." If you're ready to elevate your 3D programming skills, let's dive right in!

## Prerequisites

Before we embark on this exciting journey, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Aspose.3D for .NET Library: Download and install the library from the [release page](https://releases.aspose.com/3d/net/).

- Your Development Environment: Ensure that your development environment is set up and ready to roll.

## Import Namespaces

Start by importing the necessary namespaces to access the functionality provided by Aspose.3D for .NET. In your code, this might look like:

```csharp
using Aspose.ThreeD;
using Aspose.ThreeD.Entities;
using Aspose.ThreeD.Profiles;
using Aspose.ThreeD.Utilities;
```

Now, let's break down the example into manageable steps to master the Twist Offset in Linear Extrusion:

## Step 1: Initialize the Base Profile

Begin by creating a base profile, here exemplified by a rectangle shape with a specified rounding radius.

```csharp
var profile = new RectangleShape()
{
    RoundingRadius = 0.3
};
```

## Step 2: Create a Scene

Generate a 3D scene to host your nodes and shapes.

```csharp
Scene scene = new Scene();
```

## Step 3: Create Nodes

Construct nodes within the scene, both left and right.

```csharp
var left = scene.RootNode.CreateChildNode();
var right = scene.RootNode.CreateChildNode();
left.Transform.Translation = new Vector3(18, 0, 0);
```

## Step 4: Linear Extrusion on Left Node

Perform linear extrusion on the left node using the twist and slices property.

```csharp
left.CreateChildNode(new LinearExtrusion(profile, 10) { Twist = 360, Slices = 100 });
```

## Step 5: Linear Extrusion on Right Node with Twist Offset

On the right node, perform linear extrusion using twist, twist offset, and slices property.

```csharp
right.CreateChildNode(new LinearExtrusion(profile, 10) { Twist = 360, Slices = 100, TwistOffset = new Vector3(3, 0, 0) });
```

## Step 6: Save 3D Scene

Save the 3D scene to your desired output directory, specifying the file format as WavefrontOBJ.

```csharp
scene.Save("Your Output Directory" + "TwistOffsetInLinearExtrusion.obj", FileFormat.WavefrontOBJ);
```

Congratulations! You've successfully implemented the Twist Offset in Linear Extrusion using Aspose.3D for .NET.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we explored the powerful capabilities of Aspose.3D for .NET, specifically focusing on Twist Offset in Linear Extrusion. With these newfound skills, you're well-equipped to infuse dynamism into your 3D projects.
