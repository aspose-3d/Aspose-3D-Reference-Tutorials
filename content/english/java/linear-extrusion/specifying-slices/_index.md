## Introduction

Creating intricate 3D models often requires more than just creativity; it demands a thorough understanding of the tools at your disposal. Aspose.3D for Java is a game-changer in this regard. In this tutorial, we will focus on a specific aspect - specifying slices in linear extrusion.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. Java Environment: Ensure that you have a Java development environment set up on your system.
2. Aspose.3D for Java: Download and install the Aspose.3D library. You can find the necessary packages [here](https://releases.aspose.com/3d/java/).

## Import Packages

In your Java project, import the Aspose.3D library. This is crucial for accessing the functionalities we'll be working with. Add the following import statement to your code:

```java


import com.aspose.threed.*;

import java.io.IOException;
```

Now, let's break down the example into multiple steps.

## Step 1: Set Up the Scene

Initialize the base profile to be extruded, in this case, a `RectangleShape` with a specified rounding radius. Create a 3D scene to work within.

```java
String MyDir = "Your Document Directory";
RectangleShape profile = new RectangleShape();
profile.setRoundingRadius(0.3);
Scene scene = new Scene();
```

## Step 2: Create Nodes

Generate left and right nodes within the scene. Adjust the translation of the left node for spatial variation.

```java
Node left = scene.getRootNode().createChildNode();
Node right = scene.getRootNode().createChildNode();
left.getTransform().setTranslation(new Vector3(5, 0, 0));
```

## Step 3: Linear Extrusion with Slices

Perform linear extrusion on both nodes, specifying the number of slices for each. This is where the magic happens.

```java
left.createChildNode(new LinearExtrusion(profile, 2) {{setSlices(2);}});
right.createChildNode(new LinearExtrusion(profile, 2) {{setSlices(10);}});
```

## Step 4: Save the Scene

Save the 3D scene in the desired format, in this case, a Wavefront OBJ file.

```java
scene.save(MyDir + "SlicesInLinearExtrusion.obj", FileFormat.WAVEFRONTOBJ);
```

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully learned how to specify slices in linear extrusion using Aspose.3D for Java. This skill opens up new possibilities in your 3D modeling journey.
