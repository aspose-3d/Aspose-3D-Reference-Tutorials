## Introduction

Welcome to this comprehensive tutorial on performing linear extrusion in Aspose.3D for Java! If you're looking to enhance your 3D modeling skills using Java, you're in the right place. In this tutorial, we'll guide you through the process of performing linear extrusion using Aspose.3D, a powerful Java library for 3D modeling.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. Java Development Environment: Ensure that you have a Java development environment set up on your machine.

2. Aspose.3D Library: Download and install the Aspose.3D library. You can find the library [here](https://releases.aspose.com/3d/java/).

## Import Packages

Once you've set up your development environment and installed the Aspose.3D library, it's time to import the necessary packages. In your Java code, include the following:

```java


import com.aspose.threed.*;
```

Let's break down each step to ensure a clear understanding.

## Step 1: Set Document Directory

Define the path to your document directory:

```java
String MyDir = "Your Document Directory";
```

This ensures that the generated 3D model will be saved in the specified directory.

## Step 2: Initialize Base Shape

Create a rectangle shape as the base profile for extrusion:

```java
RectangleShape profile = new RectangleShape();
profile.setRoundingRadius(0.3);
```

Adjust the rounding radius as needed to customize the shape.

## Step 3: Perform Linear Extrusion

Perform linear extrusion on the base profile:

```java
LinearExtrusion extrusion = new LinearExtrusion(profile, 10) {{ setSlices(100); setCenter(true); setTwist(360); setTwistOffset(new Vector3(10, 0, 0));}};
```

Here, we extrude the shape by 10 units, set the number of slices, enable centering, and apply twist and twist offset.

## Step 4: Create 3D Scene

Create a 3D scene and add the extrusion as a child node:

```java
Scene scene = new Scene();
scene.getRootNode().createChildNode(extrusion);
```

## Step 5: Save 3D Scene

Save the generated 3D scene as a Wavefront OBJ file:

```java
scene.save(MyDir +  "LinearExtrusion.obj", FileFormat.WAVEFRONTOBJ);
```

Now, you've successfully performed linear extrusion using Aspose.3D for Java!

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've learned how to leverage Aspose.3D for Java to perform linear extrusion. This powerful library opens up a world of possibilities for your 3D modeling projects.
