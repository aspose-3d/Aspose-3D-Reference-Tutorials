## Introduction

Welcome to this comprehensive guide on retrieving information from 3D scenes in Java applications using Aspose.3D. If you're a Java developer looking to enhance your application's capabilities with 3D scene manipulation, you're in the right place. This tutorial will guide you through the process step by step, ensuring you grasp each concept thoroughly.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the tutorial, make sure you have the following in place:

- Basic understanding of Java programming.
- Aspose.3D library installed. If not, download it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/3d/java/).
- Java IDE (Integrated Development Environment) installed and configured.

## Import Packages

In your Java project, import the necessary packages to leverage Aspose.3D functionalities. Add the following lines to your code:

```java


import com.aspose.threed.FileFormat;
import com.aspose.threed.Scene;
```

## Step 1: Initialize a 3D Scene

```java
// ExStart:AddAssetInformationToScene
Scene scene = new Scene();
```

Begin by creating a new 3D scene using Aspose.3D's `Scene` class.

## Step 2: Set Application and Vendor Information

```java
scene.getAssetInfo().setApplicationName("Egypt");
scene.getAssetInfo().setApplicationVendor("Manualdesk");
```

Specify the application and vendor name associated with your 3D scene.

## Step 3: Define Measurement Units

```java
scene.getAssetInfo().setUnitName("pole");
scene.getAssetInfo().setUnitScaleFactor(0.6);
```

Define the measurement units for your 3D scene. In this example, we use ancient Egyptian units.

## Step 4: Save Scene to File

```java
String MyDir = "Your Document Directory";
MyDir = MyDir + "InformationToScene.fbx";
scene.save(MyDir, FileFormat.FBX7500ASCII);
// ExEnd:AddAssetInformationToScene
```

Specify the directory and filename for saving the 3D scene. The example saves the scene in FBX format with ASCII encoding.

## Step 5: Print Success Message

```java
System.out.println("\nAsset information added successfully to Scene.\nFile saved at " + MyDir);
```

Display a success message indicating that the asset information has been successfully added to the scene.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully learned how to retrieve information from 3D scenes in Java applications using Aspose.3D. This powerful library opens up endless possibilities for enhancing your Java projects with immersive 3D content.
