## Introduction

Welcome to the fascinating world of 3D graphics in Java using Aspose.3D! In this tutorial, we will guide you through the process of creating a stunning 3D cube scene using Aspose.3D for Java. Aspose.3D is a powerful Java library that provides comprehensive functionalities for working with 3D models and scenes.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the creation of the 3D cube scene, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. Java Development Kit (JDK): Make sure you have Java installed on your system. You can download the latest version from [Oracle's website](https://www.oracle.com/java/).

2. Aspose.3D for Java Library: Download and install the Aspose.3D library. You can find the download link [here](https://releases.aspose.com/3d/java/).

## Import Packages

Begin by importing the necessary packages into your Java project:

```java
package examples.geometry;

import java.io.File;

import com.aspose.threed.Box;
import com.aspose.threed.Cylinder;
import com.aspose.threed.FileFormat;
import com.aspose.threed.Mesh;
import com.aspose.threed.Node;
import com.aspose.threed.Scene;
```

Now, let's break down the process of creating a 3D cube scene into multiple steps.

## Step 1: Initialize the Scene

```java
// Initialize scene object
Scene scene = new Scene();
```

## Step 2: Initialize Node and Mesh

```java
// Initialize Node class object
Node cubeNode = new Node("box");

// Call Common class create mesh using polygon builder method to set mesh instance
Mesh mesh = Common.createMeshUsingPolygonBuilder();

// Point node to the Mesh geometry
cubeNode.setEntity(mesh);
```

## Step 3: Add Node to the Scene

```java
// Add Node to a scene
scene.getRootNode().getChildNodes().add(cubeNode);
```

## Step 4: Save the 3D Scene

```java
// The path to the documents directory.
String MyDir = "Your Document Directory";
MyDir = MyDir + "CubeScene.fbx";

// Save 3D scene in the supported file formats
scene.save(MyDir, FileFormat.FBX7400ASCII);
```

## Step 5: Print Success Message

```java
System.out.println("\nCube Scene created successfully.\nFile saved at " + MyDir);
```

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully created a 3D cube scene using Aspose.3D for Java. This tutorial provides a solid foundation for exploring more advanced features and unleashing your creativity in the world of 3D graphics.
