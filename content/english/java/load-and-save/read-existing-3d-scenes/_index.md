## Introduction

If you're diving into the world of 3D graphics and design using Java, you're in for a treat. Aspose.3D for Java is a powerful library that simplifies the process of working with 3D scenes. In this tutorial, we'll guide you through the steps of reading existing 3D scenes effortlessly, opening up a realm of possibilities for modification, addition, and processing.

## Prerequisites

Before we embark on this 3D adventure, let's make sure you have everything you need:

- Java Environment: Ensure that you have a Java development environment set up on your machine.

- Aspose.3D Library: Download and install the Aspose.3D library. You can find the necessary packages [here](https://releases.aspose.com/3d/java/).

- Document Directory: Have a directory where your 3D documents are stored. This will be referenced in the examples.

Now that you're all set, let's dive into the main steps.

## Import Packages

Before we start reading 3D scenes, let's import the necessary packages in our Java code:

```java
package examples.loadsave;

import com.aspose.threed.FileFormat;
import com.aspose.threed.Scene;


import java.io.IOException;
```

## Step 1: Set Up Your Document Directory

```java
String MyDir = "Your Document Directory";
```

Ensure you replace "Your Document Directory" with the path to the folder where your 3D documents are stored.

## Step 2: Initialize a Scene Object

```java
Scene scene = new Scene();
```

Create a Scene object to work with 3D scenes.

## Step 3: Load an Existing 3D Document

```java
scene.open(MyDir + "document.fbx");
```

This step loads an existing 3D document into the Scene object. Replace "document.fbx" with the name of your 3D file.

## Step 4: Print Confirmation

```java
System.out.println("\n3D Scene is ready for modification, addition, or processing purposes.");
```

This line confirms that the 3D scene is successfully loaded and ready for further actions.

## Additional Example: Read RVM with Attributes

If you have an RVM file with associated attributes, you can read them as follows:

```java
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
Scene scene = new Scene(dataDir + "att-test.rvm");
FileFormat.RVM_BINARY.loadAttributes(scene, dataDir + "att-test.att");
```

This example showcases reading an RVM file along with its attributes.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've just scratched the surface of the capabilities offered by Aspose.3D for Java. This tutorial is a stepping stone to more advanced 3D manipulations, paving the way for exciting projects and creations.
