## Introduction

In the realm of 3D graphics and visualization, Aspose.3D for Java stands out as a powerful tool for developers. With its versatile features and robust functionality, it provides an excellent platform for creating and manipulating 3D documents. In this tutorial, we'll guide you through the process of creating an empty 3D document in Java using Aspose.3D.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. Java Development Environment: Ensure that you have Java installed on your machine. You can download it [here](https://www.java.com/download/).

2. Aspose.3D Library: Download and install the Aspose.3D library for Java. You can find the download link [here](https://releases.aspose.com/3d/java/).

## Import Packages

Now that you have the prerequisites ready, let's import the necessary packages for our Java project. These include Aspose.3D-related packages to leverage its functionalities.

```java
package examples.loadsave;

import com.aspose.threed.FileFormat;
import com.aspose.threed.Scene;


import java.io.Console;
```

## Step 1: Set Up the Document Directory

Begin by setting up the directory where you want to save the 3D document. Replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the actual path on your machine.

```java
// Set the path to the documents directory
String MyDir = "Your Document Directory";
MyDir = MyDir + "document.fbx";
```

## Step 2: Create a Scene Object

Create an object of the Scene class, which will serve as the canvas for your 3D document.

```java
// Create an object of the Scene class
Scene scene = new Scene();
```

## Step 3: Save the 3D Scene Document

Now, save the empty 3D scene document using the specified path and file format.

```java
// Save 3D scene document
scene.save(MyDir, FileFormat.FBX7500ASCII);
```

## Step 4: Print Success Message

Finally, print a success message with the path where the file has been saved.

```java
// Print success message
System.out.println("\nAn empty 3D document created successfully.\nFile saved at " + MyDir);
```

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully created an empty 3D document in Java using Aspose.3D. This opens up a world of possibilities for your 3D graphics and visualization projects. Experiment with the Aspose.3D library to unleash its full potential.
