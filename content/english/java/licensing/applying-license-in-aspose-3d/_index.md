## Introduction

Welcome to this step-by-step guide on applying a license in Aspose.3D for Java. Aspose.3D is a powerful Java library that allows developers to work with 3D files effortlessly. In this tutorial, we will delve into the process of applying a license using various methods, ensuring you can unlock the full potential of Aspose.3D in your Java applications.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Basic understanding of Java programming.
- Aspose.3D library installed. You can download it from the [release page](https://releases.aspose.com/3d/java/).

## Import Packages

To get started, import the necessary packages into your Java project. Ensure that Aspose.3D is added to your classpath. Here's an example:

```javaimport com.aspose.threed.License;
import com.aspose.threed.Metered;

import java.io.FileInputStream;
import java.io.IOException;
```

## Applying a License Using a File

### Step 1: Create License Object

Firstly, create a `License` object in your Java code.

```java
License license = new License();
```

### Step 2: Set License from File

Specify the path to your license file and set the license using the following code:

```java
license.setLicense("Aspose._3D.lic");
```

## Applying a License Using a Stream Object

### Step 1: Create License Object

Similarly, create a `License` object in your Java code.

```java
License license = new License();
```

### Step 2: Set License from Stream Object

Utilize a `FileInputStream` to create a stream and set the license:

```java
try (FileInputStream myStream = new FileInputStream("Aspose._3D.lic")) {
    license.setLicense(myStream);
}
```

## Using Public and Private Keys

### Step 1: Initialize Metered License Object

Initialize a `Metered` license object:

```java
Metered metered = new Metered();
```

### Step 2: Set Public and Private Keys

Set your public and private keys to enable metered licensing:

```java
metered.setMeteredKey("your-public-key", "your-private-key");
```

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully learned how to apply a license in Aspose.3D for Java using various methods. Now, you can integrate Aspose.3D seamlessly into your Java applications and unlock its full potential.
