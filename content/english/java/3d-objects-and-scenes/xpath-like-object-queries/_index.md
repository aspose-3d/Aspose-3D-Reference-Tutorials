## Introduction

Delving into the realm of 3D modeling and scene manipulation in Java can be a daunting task, but fear not! Aspose.3D for Java provides a robust solution for handling 3D objects, making it an invaluable tool for developers. In this tutorial, we will guide you through the application of XPath-like queries to 3D objects in Java using Aspose.3D.

## Prerequisites

Before we embark on this exciting journey, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine.
- Aspose.3D for Java library downloaded and set up. You can find the download link [here](https://releases.aspose.com/3d/java/).
- Basic knowledge of Java programming.

## Import Packages

Let's kick things off by importing the necessary packages into your Java project. This step is crucial for integrating Aspose.3D into your development environment.

```java
import com.aspose.threed.*;

import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;
```

Now, let's explore the fascinating world of XPath-like queries with Aspose.3D for Java. Follow these steps to unleash the power of querying 3D objects:

## Step 1: Create a Scene for Testing

```java
// ExStart:CreateScene
Scene s = new Scene();
// ExEnd:CreateScene
```

## Step 2: Create a Hierarchy of Nodes

```java
// ExStart:CreateHierarchy
Node a = s.getRootNode().createChildNode("a");
a.createChildNode("a1");
a.createChildNode("a2");
s.getRootNode().createChildNode("b");
Node c = s.getRootNode().createChildNode("c");
c.createChildNode("c1").addEntity(new Camera("cam"));
c.createChildNode("c2").addEntity(new Light("light"));
// ExEnd:CreateHierarchy
```

## Step 3: Apply XPath-Like Queries

```java
// ExStart:XPathLikeObjectQueries
// Select objects that have type Camera or name is 'light' regardless of their location.
List<Object> objects = s.getRootNode().selectObjects("//*[(@Type = 'Camera') or (@Name = 'light')]");

// Select a single camera object under the child nodes of the node named 'c' under the root node
A3DObject c1 = (A3DObject) s.getRootNode().selectSingleObject("/c/*/<Camera>");

// Select the node named 'a1' under the root node, even if 'a1' is not a directly child node
A3DObject obj = (A3DObject) s.getRootNode().selectSingleObject("a1");

// Select the node itself, as '/' is selected directly on the root node
obj = (A3DObject) s.getRootNode().selectSingleObject("/");
// ExEnd:XPathLikeObjectQueries
```

Congratulations! You've successfully harnessed the power of XPath-like queries in Aspose.3D for Java.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we've demystified the process of applying XPath-like queries to 3D objects using Aspose.3D for Java. With this newfound knowledge, you can navigate and manipulate complex 3D scenes with ease.
