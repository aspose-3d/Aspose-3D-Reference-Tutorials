## Introduction

Welcome to our step-by-step guide on modifying the radius of a 3D sphere using Aspose.3D for Java. Aspose.3D is a powerful Java library that enables developers to work with 3D files and manipulate them seamlessly. In this tutorial, we will focus on changing the radius of a 3D sphere using practical examples and detailed explanations.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Basic understanding of Java programming.
- Aspose.3D library installed. You can download it from the [Aspose.3D for Java documentation](https://reference.aspose.com/3d/java/).
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine.

## Import Packages

To get started, import the necessary packages into your Java project. Add the following lines to your code:

```java


import com.aspose.threed.FileFormat;
import com.aspose.threed.Scene;
import com.aspose.threed.Sphere;

import java.io.IOException;
```

## Step 1: Initialize a Scene

```java
// ExStart:WorkingWithSphereRadius

// initialize a scene
Scene scene = new Scene();
```

Here, we create a new 3D scene using Aspose.3D for Java.

## Step 2: Initialize a Sphere

```java
// initialize a Sphere
Sphere sphere = new Sphere();
```

Create a new Sphere object that will be added to the scene.

## Step 3: Set Radius

```java
// set radius
sphere.setRadius(10);
```

Set the desired radius for the sphere. In this example, we set it to 10 units.

## Step 4: Add Sphere to the Scene

```java
// add sphere to the scene
scene.getRootNode().createChildNode(sphere);
```

Add the created sphere to the root node of the scene.

## Step 5: Save Scene

```java
// save scene
scene.save("sphere.obj", FileFormat.WAVEFRONTOBJ);
```

Save the modified scene with the new sphere to a 3D file. In this case, we save it as "sphere.obj" in Wavefront OBJ format.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully modified the 3D sphere radius using Aspose.3D for Java. This tutorial provided a clear and concise guide, allowing you to integrate these steps into your Java projects effortlessly.
