## Introduction

In the realm of Java-based 3D modeling, Aspose.3D stands out as a powerful tool, offering developers the capability to create intricate 3D scenes with ease. In this tutorial, we'll delve into the fascinating world of Aspose.3D for Java, focusing on a specific task â€“ creating cylinders with offset tops. By the end of this guide, you'll have a firm grasp of the process, allowing you to integrate this feature seamlessly into your 3D projects.

## Prerequisites

Before we embark on this creative journey, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Java Development Kit (JDK): Aspose.3D for Java requires a compatible JDK installed on your machine.
- Aspose.3D Library: Download and integrate the Aspose.3D library into your Java project. You can find the library and detailed documentation [here](https://releases.aspose.com/3d/java/).

## Import Packages

Let's kick off the process by importing the necessary packages for our Java project. In your code, include the following:

```java
package examples.WorkingWithCylinder;

import com.aspose.threed.Cylinder;
import com.aspose.threed.FileFormat;
import com.aspose.threed.Scene;
import com.aspose.threed.Vector3;


import java.io.IOException;
```

## Step 1: Create a Scene

Begin by initializing a scene where you'll orchestrate your 3D elements.

```java
// ExStart:1
// Create a scene
Scene scene = new Scene();
// ExEnd:1
```

## Step 2: Initialize Cylinder with Offset Top

Next, create a cylinder object with a customized offset top using the following code:

```java
// ExStart:2
// Initialize cylinder
Cylinder cylinder1 = new Cylinder(2, 2, 10, 20, 1, false);
// Set OffsetTop
cylinder1.setOffsetTop(new Vector3(5, 3, 0));
// ExEnd:2
```

## Step 3: Create Child Node

Now, create a child node in the scene and set the translation for the first cylinder:

```java
// ExStart:3
// Create ChildNode
scene.getRootNode().createChildNode(cylinder1).getTransform().setTranslation(10, 0, 0);
// ExEnd:3
```

## Step 4: Initialize Second Cylinder

Let's initialize a second cylinder without a customized offset top:

```java
// ExStart:4
// Initialize second cylinder without customized OffsetTop
Cylinder cylinder2 = new Cylinder(2, 2, 10, 20, 1, false);
// ExEnd:4
```

## Step 5: Create Child Node for Second Cylinder

Create a child node for the second cylinder in the scene:

```java
// ExStart:5
// Create ChildNode
scene.getRootNode().createChildNode(cylinder2);
// ExEnd:5
```

## Step 6: Save the Scene

Finally, save the scene with the created cylinders as a Wavefront OBJ file in your document directory:

```java
// ExStart:6
// Save
scene.save("Your Document Directory" + "CustomizedOffsetTopCylinder.obj", FileFormat.WAVEFRONTOBJ);
// ExEnd:6
```

With these simple steps, you've successfully created 3D cylinders with offset tops using Aspose.3D for Java!

## Conclusion

Aspose.3D for Java empowers developers to bring their 3D visions to life effortlessly. In this tutorial, we focused on creating cylinders with offset tops, showcasing the versatility and simplicity of Aspose.3D.
