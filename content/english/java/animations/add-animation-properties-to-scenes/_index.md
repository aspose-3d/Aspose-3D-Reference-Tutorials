## Introduction

Welcome to this step-by-step tutorial on adding animation properties to 3D scenes in Java using Aspose.3D. If you're looking to enhance your 3D projects with dynamic animations, you're in the right place. In this guide, we'll walk you through the process, breaking down each step for a seamless experience.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Basic knowledge of Java programming.
- Aspose.3D library installed. If not, download it from the [release page](https://releases.aspose.com/3d/java/).

## Import Packages

In your Java project, ensure you import the necessary packages to leverage Aspose.3D functionalities:

```java
import com.aspose.threed.*;

import examples.geometry.Common;
```

Now, let's move on to the step-by-step guide.

## Step 1: Initialize the Scene

```java
// Initialize scene object
Scene scene = new Scene();
```

## Step 2: Create Mesh using Polygon Builder

```java
// Call Common class create mesh using polygon builder method to set mesh instance
Mesh mesh = Common.createMeshUsingPolygonBuilder();
```

## Step 3: Create Cube Node with Translation

```java
// Each cube node has its own translation
Node cube1 = scene.getRootNode().createChildNode("cube1", mesh);
```

## Step 4: Find Translation Property

```java
// Find translation property on node's transform object
Property translation = cube1.getTransform().findProperty("Translation");
```

## Step 5: Create Bind Point

```java
// Create a bind point based on the translation property
BindPoint bindPoint = new BindPoint(scene, translation);
```

## Step 6: Create Animation Curve

```java
// Create the animation curve on the X component of the scale
KeyframeSequence kfs = new KeyframeSequence();

// Add keyframes for X component
kfs.add(0, 10.0f, Interpolation.BEZIER);
kfs.add(3, 20.0f, Interpolation.BEZIER);
kfs.add(5, 30.0f, Interpolation.LINEAR);

// Bind the keyframe sequence to the X component
bindPoint.bindKeyframeSequence("X", kfs);
```

## Step 7: Repeat for Z Component

```java
// Repeat the process for the Z component
kfs = new KeyframeSequence();
kfs.add(0, 10.0f, Interpolation.BEZIER);
kfs.add(3, -10.0f, Interpolation.BEZIER);
kfs.add(5, 0.0f, Interpolation.LINEAR);

bindPoint.bindKeyframeSequence("Z", kfs);
```

## Step 8: Save the 3D Scene

```java
// Specify the directory for saving the 3D scene
String MyDir = "Your Document Directory";
MyDir = MyDir + "PropertyToDocument.fbx";

// Save 3D scene in the supported file formats
scene.save(MyDir, FileFormat.FBX7500ASCII);
```

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully added animation properties to your 3D scene using Aspose.3D in Java. Experiment with different parameters to achieve the desired animations for your projects.
