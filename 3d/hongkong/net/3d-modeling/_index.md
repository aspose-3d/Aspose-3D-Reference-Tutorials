## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I use Aspose.3D to **build 3d cylinder** in a real‑time game engine?**  
A: Yes. Export the generated cylinder mesh to formats like FBX or OBJ, which are widely supported by game engines such as Unity and Unreal.

**Q: How do I **change plane orientation** for a mesh that’s already been created?**  
A: Use the `Node.Transform` property to apply rotation matrices or Euler angles to the node that contains your mesh.

**Q: What is the best way to **generate 3d mesh** data for large scenes?**  
A: Batch‑create geometry, reuse materials, and call `Scene.Optimize` before exporting to keep memory usage low.

**Q: Is there a limit to the number of segments when I **create cylinder mesh**?**  
A: Practically, you’re limited only by memory and performance; typical cylinders use 16‑32 radial segments for a smooth appearance.

**Q: Do I need a separate license for each .NET platform?**  
A: No. A single Aspose.3D license covers all supported .NET runtimes.
