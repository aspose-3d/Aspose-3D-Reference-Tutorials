# Extracting Information to Scene Assets

## Introduction

Welcome to this comprehensive tutorial on using Aspose.3D for .NET to extract valuable information and enhance your 3D scenes. Aspose.3D is a powerful library that empowers developers to manipulate 3D scenes seamlessly within .NET applications. In this tutorial, we'll focus on the crucial task of adding asset information to a scene.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the tutorial, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Aspose.3D for .NET: Make sure you have the library installed. You can download it from the [Aspose.3D for .NET page](https://releases.aspose.com/3d/net/).

## Import Namespaces

In your .NET project, make sure to include the necessary namespaces to access Aspose.3D functionalities:

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using System.Collections;
using Aspose.ThreeD;
```

## Step 1: Initialize a 3D Scene

```csharp
Scene scene = new Scene();
```

Create a new 3D scene using the `Scene` class.

## Step 2: Set Application and Vendor Information

```csharp
scene.AssetInfo.ApplicationName = "Egypt";
scene.AssetInfo.ApplicationVendor = "Manualdesk";
```

Define the application and vendor names associated with your 3D scene.

## Step 3: Define Measurement Units

```csharp
scene.AssetInfo.UnitName = "pole";
scene.AssetInfo.UnitScaleFactor = 0.6;
```

Specify the measurement units used in your scene. In this example, we use ancient Egyptian units called "pole," with 1 pole equal to 60cm.

## Step 4: Save the Scene

```csharp
var output = "Your Output Directory" + "InformationToScene.fbx";
scene.Save(output, FileFormat.FBX7500ASCII);
```

Save the scene with the added asset information to a 3D-supported file format. Adjust the output directory as needed.

## Step 5: Display Success Message

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("\nAsset information added successfully to Scene.\nFile saved at " + output);
```

Inform the user that the asset information has been successfully added, and the file is saved.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully learned how to use Aspose.3D for .NET to extract and add essential asset information to your 3D scenes. This knowledge opens up endless possibilities for creating more informative and engaging 3D content.
