# Setting Three-Dimensional Properties in 3D Scenes

## Introduction

Creating captivating three-dimensional scenes often requires the ability to manipulate various properties, adding depth and realism to your projects. Aspose.3D for .NET provides a powerful toolset to achieve this, allowing you to set and modify three-dimensional properties within your 3D scenes effortlessly. In this tutorial, we'll explore the process step by step, enhancing your understanding of how to leverage Aspose.3D for .NET effectively.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- Aspose.3D for .NET: Ensure you have the library installed in your .NET project. You can download it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/3d/net/).

- Document Directory: Create a directory to store your 3D documents.

Now that you have the essentials in place, let's explore the process of setting three-dimensional properties in 3D scenes using Aspose.3D for .NET.

## Import Namespaces

To get started, import the necessary namespaces into your project. These namespaces provide the classes and methods required for working with three-dimensional properties in Aspose.3D for .NET.

```csharp
using Aspose.ThreeD;
using Aspose.ThreeD.Shading;
using Aspose.ThreeD.Utilities;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
```

## Step 1: Load 3D Scene

Begin by loading a 3D scene. In this example, we use an FBX file with an embedded texture.

```csharp
//ExStart: Load3DScene
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
Scene scene = new Scene(dataDir + "EmbeddedTexture.fbx");
//ExEnd: Load3DScene
```

## Step 2: Access Material Properties

Access the material properties of the loaded 3D scene to manipulate its characteristics.

```csharp
//ExStart: AccessMaterialProperties
Material material = scene.RootNode.ChildNodes[0].Material;
PropertyCollection props = material.Properties;
//ExEnd: AccessMaterialProperties
```

## Step 3: List All Properties

List all the properties of the material using a foreach loop or an ordinal for loop.

```csharp
//ExStart: ListAllProperties
foreach (var prop in props)
{
    Console.WriteLine("{0} = {1}", prop.Name, prop.Value);
}

//or using ordinal for loop
for (int i = 0; i < props.Count; i++)
{
    var prop = props[i];
    Console.WriteLine("{0} = {1}", prop.Name, prop.Value);
}
//ExEnd: ListAllProperties
```

## Step 4: Get and Modify Property by Name

Retrieve and modify a specific property by its name.

```csharp
//ExStart: GetModifyPropertyByName
var diffuse = props["Diffuse"];
Console.WriteLine(diffuse);

//modify property value by name
props["Diffuse"] = new Vector3(1, 0, 1);
//ExEnd: GetModifyPropertyByName
```

## Step 5: Get Property Instance by Name

Retrieve a property instance by its name for further manipulation.

```csharp
//ExStart: GetPropertyInstanceByName
Property pdiffuse = props.FindProperty("Diffuse");
Console.WriteLine(pdiffuse);
//ExEnd: GetPropertyInstanceByName
```

## Step 6: Traverse Property's Properties

Since `Property` is inherited from `A3DObject`, you can traverse the properties of a property.

```csharp
//ExStart: TraversePropertyProperties
Console.WriteLine("Property flags = {0}", pdiffuse.GetProperty("flags"));

//and some properties that only defined in FBX file:
Console.WriteLine("Label = {0}", pdiffuse.GetProperty("label"));
Console.WriteLine("Type Name = {0}", pdiffuse.GetProperty("typeName"));

//traversal on property's property is possible
foreach (var pp in pdiffuse.Properties)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Diffuse.{0} = {1}", pp.Name, pp.Value);
}
//ExEnd: TraversePropertyProperties
```

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've now mastered the art of setting three-dimensional properties in 3D scenes using Aspose.3D for .NET. Experiment with different properties and values to bring your 3D projects to life.
