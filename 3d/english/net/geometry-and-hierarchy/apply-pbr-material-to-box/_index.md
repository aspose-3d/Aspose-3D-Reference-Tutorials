# Applying PBR Material to Box

## Introduction

Welcome to the fascinating world of 3D graphics! In this step-by-step guide, we'll explore the powerful Aspose.3D for .NET library and learn how to create stunning 3D scenes using Physically Based Rendering (PBR) materials. Aspose.3D simplifies the complex process of 3D graphics and opens up a realm of possibilities for developers.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the exciting world of 3D graphics, let's ensure you have everything set up:

### Download and Install Aspose.3D for .NET

Visit the [Aspose.3D for .NET documentation](https://reference.aspose.com/3d/net/) for detailed instructions on downloading and installing the library.

### Acquire a License

To unlock the full potential of Aspose.3D, obtain a valid license. You can get a temporary license [here](https://purchase.aspose.com/temporary-license/) or purchase a full license [here](https://purchase.aspose.com/buy).

## Import Namespaces

Firstly, make sure to import the necessary namespaces to leverage the capabilities of Aspose.3D for .NET:

```csharp
using Aspose.ThreeD;
using Aspose.ThreeD.Entities;
using Aspose.ThreeD.Shading;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
```

## Step 1: Initialize a Scene

Begin by initializing a 3D scene using the following code snippet:

```csharp
Scene scene = new Scene();
```

## Step 2: Initialize PBR Material

Create a PBR material object to achieve realistic rendering:

```csharp
PbrMaterial mat = new PbrMaterial();
```

## Step 3: Set Material Properties

Fine-tune the material properties, making it almost metallic and very rough:

```csharp
mat.MetallicFactor = 0.9;
mat.RoughnessFactor = 0.9;
```

## Step 4: Create a Box

Generate a box to which the PBR material will be applied:

```csharp
var boxNode = scene.RootNode.CreateChildNode("box", new Box());
```

## Step 5: Apply Material to the Box

Assign the PBR material to the created box node:

```csharp
boxNode.Material = mat;
```

## Step 6: Save the 3D Scene

Save the 3D scene into STL format with the desired output directory:

```csharp
scene.Save("Your Output Directory" + "PBR_Material_Box_Out.stl", FileFormat.STLASCII);
```

Congratulations! You've successfully applied a PBR material to a box in a 3D scene using Aspose.3D for .NET.

## Conclusion

Venturing into 3D graphics with Aspose.3D for .NET opens doors to endless creative possibilities. With its intuitive API and robust features, creating visually stunning scenes becomes an enjoyable experience for developers.
