# Applying Material to Cube

## Introduction

Welcome to the fascinating world of 3D graphics manipulation using Aspose.3D for .NET! In this tutorial, we'll dive into the process of applying materials to a cube in your 3D scenes, adding a whole new level of realism and visual appeal to your creations.

## Prerequisites

Before we embark on this exciting journey, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Basic understanding of C# programming language
- Familiarity with 3D graphics concepts
- Installed Aspose.3D for .NET library

Now, let's get started with the step-by-step guide.

## Import Namespaces

Begin by importing the necessary namespaces to your C# project. This step is crucial to access the functionalities provided by Aspose.3D for .NET.

```csharp
using System;
using Aspose.ThreeD;
using Aspose.ThreeD.Entities;
using Aspose.ThreeD.Utilities;
using Aspose.ThreeD.Shading;
using System.Drawing;
using System.IO;
```

## Step 1: Initialize Scene and Cube

```csharp
// ExStart:InitializeSceneAndCube
// Initialize scene object
Scene scene = new Scene();

// Create a box instance.
var box = new Box();

// Attach box instance to scene
Node cubeNode = scene.RootNode.CreateChildNode(box);

// ExEnd:InitializeSceneAndCube
```

## Step 2: Create Phong Material and Texture

```csharp
// ExStart:CreatePhongMaterialAndTexture
// Initialize PhongMaterial object
PhongMaterial mat = new PhongMaterial();

// Initialize Texture object
Texture diffuse = new Texture();

// Set local file path for the texture
diffuse.FileName = "surface.dds";

// Set Texture of the material
mat.SetTexture("DiffuseColor", diffuse);
// ExEnd:CreatePhongMaterialAndTexture
```

## Step 3: Embed Raw Content Data (Optional)

```csharp
// ExStart:EmbedRawContentData
// Set file name
diffuse.FileName = "embedded-texture.png";

// Set binary content
diffuse.Content = File.ReadAllBytes("aspose-logo.jpg");
// ExEnd:EmbedRawContentData
```

## Step 4: Set Material Properties

```csharp
// ExStart:SetMaterialProperties
// Set color
mat.SpecularColor = new Vector3(Color.Red);

// Set brightness
mat.Shininess = 100;

// Set material property of the cube object
cubeNode.Material = mat;
// ExEnd:SetMaterialProperties
```

## Step 5: Save the 3D Scene

```csharp
// ExStart:Save3DScene
var output = "MaterialToCube.fbx";

// Save 3D scene in the supported file formats
scene.Save(output);
// ExEnd:Save3DScene

Console.WriteLine("\nMaterial added successfully to cube.\nFile saved at " + output);
```

Now, you've successfully applied materials to a cube in your 3D scene using Aspose.3D for .NET. Experiment with different textures and materials to unleash your creativity!
