# Geometry and Hierarchy

## Introduction

Welcome to the ultimate guide for **geometric transformation 3d** using Aspose.3D for .NET. Whether you’re just starting out or you’ve been building 3D applications for years, this collection of hands‑on tutorials will help you master everything from applying PBR material to manipulating nodes with a transformation matrix. Let’s dive in and see how you can turn concepts into real‑world 3D scenes.

## Geometric Transformation 3D Overview

In this section we give you a quick snapshot of the core topics covered below. You’ll learn how to:

* Apply physically‑based rendering (PBR) materials to objects for realistic lighting.  
* Navigate and query the scene hierarchy with XPath‑like syntax.  
* Concatenate and apply quaternions, Euler angles, and transformation matrices to nodes.  

Each tutorial is self‑contained, includes sample code, and shows the expected visual result, so you can follow along step‑by‑step.
