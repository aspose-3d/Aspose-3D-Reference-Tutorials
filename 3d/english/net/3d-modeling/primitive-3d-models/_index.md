# Creating Primitive 3D Models

## Introduction

Welcome to the exciting world of 3D modeling with Aspose.3D for .NET! In this comprehensive tutorial, we will explore the process of creating primitive 3D models using Aspose.3D in a step-by-step manner. Whether you are a seasoned developer or a curious beginner, this guide will help you harness the power of Aspose.3D to craft visually stunning 3D elements for your projects.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the fascinating realm of 3D modeling, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Aspose.3D for .NET: Download and install the Aspose.3D for .NET library from the [download link](https://releases.aspose.com/3d/net/).

- Development Environment: Set up a .NET development environment, ensuring compatibility with Aspose.3D.

Now that you have the essentials, let's embark on our journey to create primitive 3D models step by step.

## Import Namespaces

Begin by importing the necessary namespaces to access the functionality provided by Aspose.3D:

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using System.Collections;
using Aspose.ThreeD;
using Aspose.ThreeD.Animation;
using Aspose.ThreeD.Entities;
using Aspose.ThreeD.Formats;
```

With these namespaces in place, you are ready to unleash the power of Aspose.3D in your .NET application.

## Step 1: Initialize a Scene Object

```csharp
// Initialize a Scene object
Scene scene = new Scene();
```

Create a new scene object, which serves as the canvas for your 3D masterpiece.

## Step 2: Create a Box Model

```csharp
// Create a Box model
scene.RootNode.CreateChildNode("box", new Box());
```

Add a box model to the root of your scene. Customize the dimensions and properties of the box according to your creative vision.

## Step 3: Create a Cylinder Model

```csharp
// Create a Cylinder model
scene.RootNode.CreateChildNode("cylinder", new Cylinder());
```

Enhance your scene by introducing a cylinder model. Adjust its parameters to achieve the desired shape and size.

## Step 4: Save Drawing in FBX Format

```csharp
// Save drawing in the FBX format
var output = "Your Output Directory" + "test.fbx";
scene.Save(output, FileFormat.FBX7500ASCII);
```

Save your 3D masterpiece in the FBX format. Choose a suitable output directory and file name for your creation.

## Step 5: Display Success Message

```csharp
// Display success message
Console.WriteLine("\nBuilding a scene from primitive 3D models successfully.\nFile saved at " + output);
```

Celebrate your achievement! The scene is successfully built from primitive 3D models, and the file is saved.
