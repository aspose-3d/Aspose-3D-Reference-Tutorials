# Khronos glTF support

## Introduction

In this tutorial series, we'll explore the intricacies of glTF support in Aspose.3D, unlocking a world of creative possibilities.

## Enable compression in glTF

Aspose.3D offers compression support during glTF exporting, optimizing file sizes without compromising visual quality. This feature streamlines the distribution and loading of 3D models across platforms and applications, enhancing performance and reducing bandwidth requirements for web-based and real-time 3D experiences.

## Export meta data in glTF

Aspose.3D empowers users to seamlessly export custom user data to glTF files, enriching 3D models with additional information. This feature enables enhanced interoperability and collaboration by preserving user-specific data attributes during the export process, ensuring compatibility with glTF-supported applications and workflows.

## Non-PBR to PBR material conversion

Aspose.3D facilitates the conversion of non-PBR (Physically Based Rendering) materials to PBR materials during glTF exporting. This feature enhances the visual fidelity and realism of 3D models by seamlessly transitioning materials to the PBR workflow, ensuring compatibility with modern rendering engines and applications.
