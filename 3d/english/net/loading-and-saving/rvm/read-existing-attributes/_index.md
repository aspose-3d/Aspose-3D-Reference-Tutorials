## Introduction

In the ever-evolving landscape of 3D graphics and modeling, Aspose.3D for .NET emerges as a powerful tool, providing seamless integration and robust functionality for developers. This tutorial will guide you through the process of reading an RVM file, specifically focusing on reading its external attributes. Buckle up as we embark on a journey to harness the capabilities of Aspose.3D!

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the coding adventure, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Basic understanding of C# programming language.
- Visual Studio installed on your machine.
- Aspose.3D for .NET library downloaded and added to your project.

Now, let's get our hands dirty with some code!

## Import Namespaces

In your C# project, ensure you have the necessary namespaces included:

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using System.Collections;
using Aspose.ThreeD;
```

These namespaces will provide the essential building blocks for our 3D manipulation.



## Step 1: Load RVM File
```csharp
Scene scene = Scene.FromFile("att-test.rvm");
```

Aspose.3D  will load the external attribute file `att-test.att` `att-test.attrib` or `att-test.txt` automatically if it exists in the same directory.


## Step 2: Manually load attribute file

``csharp
FileFormat.RvmBinary.LoadAttributes(scene, "attribute-file.att");
```

If the attribute file has different name or in different directory, you can use this way to manually load the attribute file and apply attributes to the scene.

In this step, we extend our capabilities by reading an RVM file with associated attributes. Adjust the file paths according to your project structure.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully navigated through the intricacies of reading external RVM attributes to existing 3D scenes using Aspose.3D for .NET. This tutorial merely scratches the surface, so dive deeper into the [documentation](https://reference.aspose.com/3d/net/) for more advanced features.
