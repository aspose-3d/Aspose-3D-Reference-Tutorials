## Introduction

In the dynamic world of 3D modeling and rendering, efficiency and flexibility are paramount. Aspose.3D for .NET empowers developers to seamlessly export 3D scenes to compressed AMF (Additive Manufacturing File) format, ensuring optimal file size without compromising on quality. This tutorial will guide you through the process step by step, making it easy for both beginners and experienced developers to harness the capabilities of Aspose.3D for .NET.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- Basic understanding of 3D modeling concepts
- Visual Studio installed on your machine
- Aspose.3D for .NET library. You can download it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/3d/net/)
- A desire to enhance your 3D development skills!

## Import Namespaces

In your project, ensure you import the necessary namespaces to leverage the functionality of Aspose.3D for .NET:

```csharp
using Aspose.ThreeD;
using Aspose.ThreeD.Entities;
using Aspose.ThreeD.Formats;
using Aspose.ThreeD.Utilities;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
```

## Step 1: Load a 3D Scene

Begin by loading a 3D scene using Aspose.3D for .NET. Create a scene object and add entities such as boxes to it:

```csharp
Scene scene = new Scene();
var box = new Box();
var tr = scene.RootNode.CreateChildNode(box).Transform;
tr.Scale = new Vector3(12, 12, 12);
tr.Translation = new Vector3(10, 0, 0);
```

## Step 2: Scale Transform

Next, apply a scale transform to another box in the scene:

```csharp
tr = scene.RootNode.CreateChildNode(box).Transform;
tr.Scaling = new Vector3(5, 5, 5);
```

## Step 3: Set Euler Angles

Set Euler angles for the transformation:

```csharp
tr.EulerAngles = new Vector3(50, 10, 0);
```

## Step 4: Save Compressed AMF File

Finally, save the 3D scene to a compressed AMF file in your desired output directory:

```csharp
scene.Save("Your Output Directory/" + "Aspose.amf", new AmfSaveOptions() { EnableCompression = false });
```

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully exported a 3D scene to a compressed AMF format using Aspose.3D for .NET. This powerful library opens up a world of possibilities for 3D developers, allowing them to create efficient and visually stunning models.
