## Introduction

Welcome to this comprehensive guide on extracting raw 3D contents from PDF using Aspose.3D for .NET. Aspose.3D is a powerful and versatile API that allows developers to work with 3D files effortlessly. In this tutorial, we'll focus on the process of extracting raw 3D contents from PDF files, providing you with step-by-step guidance.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the tutorial, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Aspose.3D for .NET: Make sure you have the Aspose.3D for .NET library installed. You can find more information and download the library [here](https://releases.aspose.com/3d/net/).

## Import Namespaces

In your .NET project, make sure to import the necessary namespaces to utilize the functionality provided by Aspose.3D. Add the following namespaces at the beginning of your code:

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using System.Text;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using Aspose.ThreeD;
using Aspose.ThreeD.Formats;
```

Now, let's break down the process of extracting raw 3D contents from a PDF file into multiple steps.

## Step 1: Load the PDF File

To begin, you need to load the PDF file containing the 3D contents. Use the following code:

```csharp
// The path to the documents directory.
byte[] password = null;
// Extract 3D contents
List<byte[]> contents = FileFormat.PDF.Extract(RunExamples.GetDataFilePath("House_Design.pdf"), password);
```

## Step 2: Iterate Through Contents

Once the 3D contents are extracted, iterate through each of them using a loop:

```csharp
int i = 1;
// Iterate through the contents and in separate 3D files
foreach (byte[] content in contents)
{
    string fileName = "3d-" + (i++);
    File.WriteAllBytes(fileName, content);
}
```

## Step 3: Save 3D Files

Save each 3D content as a separate file using the `File.WriteAllBytes` method. This step ensures that you have individual 3D files for further processing.

```csharp
File.WriteAllBytes(fileName, content);
```

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully learned how to extract raw 3D contents from a PDF file using Aspose.3D for .NET. This process can be invaluable in scenarios where you need to work with 3D data embedded in PDF documents.
