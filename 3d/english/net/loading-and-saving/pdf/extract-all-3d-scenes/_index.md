# Extracting All 3D Scenes

## Introduction

Welcome to the exciting world of Aspose.3D for .NET, a cutting-edge library that empowers developers to effortlessly manipulate and process 3D scenes in their applications. In this step-by-step guide, we will delve into the fundamental aspects of loading, saving, and extracting 3D scenes using Aspose.3D for .NET. Whether you're a seasoned developer or a newcomer to the realm of 3D graphics, this tutorial is crafted to provide you with a seamless learning experience.

## Prerequisites

Before we embark on this journey, let's ensure that you have everything set up to make the most of this tutorial. Here are the prerequisites:

- Basic Knowledge of .NET Framework: Familiarity with the .NET framework is essential for understanding the nuances of Aspose.3D for .NET.
- Aspose.3D for .NET Library: Make sure you have the Aspose.3D for .NET library installed. You can download it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/3d/net/).
- IDE (Integrated Development Environment): Have an IDE like Visual Studio installed on your system.

## Import Namespaces

In your project, start by importing the necessary namespaces to harness the power of Aspose.3D for .NET efficiently. The following namespaces are vital for working with 3D scenes:

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using System.Text;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using Aspose.ThreeD;
using Aspose.ThreeD.Formats;
```

Now that we've set the stage let's dive into the practical aspects of loading, saving, and extracting 3D scenes.

## Loading and Saving - Extracting All 3D Scenes

### Step 1: Import the Required Libraries

Begin by importing the Aspose.3D namespaces at the top of your C# file:

```csharp
using Aspose.ThreeD;
using Aspose.ThreeD.Entities;
using Aspose.ThreeD.Formats;
```

### Step 2: Load the 3D Scene

Utilize the `FileFormat.PDF.ExtractScene` method to load a 3D scene from a PDF file. Specify the file path and, if applicable, provide a password for encrypted files.

```csharp
byte[] password = null;
List<Scene> scenes = FileFormat.PDF.ExtractScene(RunExamples.GetDataFilePath("House_Design.pdf"), password);
```

### Step 3: Iterate Through Scenes

Once the scenes are loaded, iterate through each scene and save them in a desired 3D file format (e.g., FBX). Adjust the file name and format as needed.

```csharp
int i = 1;
foreach (Scene scene in scenes)
{
    string fileName = "3d-" + (i++) + ".fbx";
    scene.Save(RunExamples.GetOutputFilePath(fileName), FileFormat.FBX7400ASCII);
}
```

### Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully navigated the intricacies of loading, saving, and extracting 3D scenes using Aspose.3D for .NET. This tutorial is just the beginning of what you can achieve with this powerful library. Experiment, explore, and elevate your 3D development projects with Aspose.3D.
