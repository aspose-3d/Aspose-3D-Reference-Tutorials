# Applying License to Aspose.3D for .NET

## Introduction

Are you ready to unlock the full potential of Aspose.3D for .NET? Applying a license is your key to accessing advanced features and ensuring seamless integration. In this step-by-step guide, we'll walk you through various methods of applying a license, ensuring a smooth setup process for your Aspose.3D application.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the tutorial, make sure you have the following:

- Basic understanding of Aspose.3D for .NET.
- Aspose.3D library installed in your .NET project.
- Access to the license file, whether it's embedded, in a file, or using public and private keys.

## Import Namespaces

Ensure you've added the necessary namespaces to your project:

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
namespace Aspose._3D.Examples.CSharp.License
```

Now, let's break down each example into multiple steps.

## Applying License Using File

### Step 1: Instantiate License Object

```csharp
Aspose.ThreeD.License license = new Aspose.ThreeD.License();
```

### Step 2: Set License from File

```csharp
license.SetLicense("Aspose._3D.lic");
```

## Applying License Using Stream Object

### Step 1: Instantiate License Object

```csharp
Aspose.ThreeD.License license = new Aspose.ThreeD.License();
```

### Step 2: Create FileStream

```csharp
FileStream myStream = new FileStream("Aspose._3D.lic", FileMode.Open);
```

### Step 3: Set License from Stream

```csharp
license.SetLicense(myStream);
```

## Applying License Using Embedded Resource

### Step 1: Instantiate License Object

```csharp
Aspose.ThreeD.License license = new Aspose.ThreeD.License();
```

### Step 2: Set License from Embedded Resource

```csharp
license.SetLicense("Aspose._3D.lic");
```

## Using Public and Private Keys

### Step 1: Initialize Metered License

```csharp
Aspose.ThreeD.Metered metered = new Aspose.ThreeD.Metered();
```

### Step 2: Set Public and Private Keys

```csharp
metered.SetMeteredKey("your-public-key", "your-private-key");
```

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully learned how to apply a license to Aspose.3D for .NET. Ensure a smooth development experience by following these steps.
