## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What is the main advantage of using linear extrusion over other modeling techniques?**  
A: Linear extrusion lets you create complex 3‑D solids from simple 2‑D profiles quickly, with full control over direction, slices, twist, and center positioning.

**Q: Can I combine multiple extrusion parameters (e.g., twist and offset) in a single operation?**  
A: Yes. Aspose.3D’s API allows you to set twist, twist offset, slice count, and center simultaneously, giving you fine‑grained control over the final shape.

**Q: Is there a limit to the number of slices I can specify?**  
A: Practically, the limit is bounded by memory and performance considerations. For most use‑cases, a slice count between 10 and 200 provides smooth results without excessive overhead.

**Q: Do I need a paid license to run these examples?**  
A: A free evaluation license is sufficient for development and testing. For production deployments, a commercial license is required.

**Q: Which version of Aspose.3D is used in these tutorials?**  
A: The examples target the latest stable release of Aspose.3D for Java at the time of writing (2025).
