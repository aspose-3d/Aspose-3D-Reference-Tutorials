# Creating 3D Models with Linear Extrusion in Java

## Introduction

If you’ve ever wondered **how to extrude shape** in a Java application, you’re in the right place. In this tutorial we’ll walk through Aspose.3D for Java’s linear extrusion features, showing you how to turn simple 2‑D profiles into fully fledged 3‑D models. Whether you’re building a CAD‑style viewer, a game asset pipeline, or just experimenting with geometry, mastering linear extrusion will give you the confidence to create complex shapes with just a few lines of code.

## Quick Answers
- **What is linear extrusion?** Turning a 2‑D sketch into a 3‑D solid by extending it along a direction.  
- **Which library helps you?** Aspose.3D for Java provides a fluent API for extrusion tasks.  
- **Do I need a license?** A free trial works for learning; a commercial license is required for production.  
- **What Java version is required?** Java 8 or higher.  
- **Can I apply twists or offsets?** Yes – the API supports twist angle and twist offset out of the box.  

## What is “how to extrude shape” in Java?

Linear extrusion is the process of taking a flat contour (like a rectangle or custom polygon) and extending it along a straight line to generate volume. In Aspose.3D, you define the profile, set extrusion parameters (center, direction, slices, twist, etc.), and the library builds the mesh for you.

## Why use Aspose.3D for Java?

- **Robust geometry engine** – Handles complex meshes, normals, and UVs automatically.  
- **Cross‑platform** – Works on Windows, Linux, and macOS without native dependencies.  
- **Extensive documentation** – Plenty of examples and API references to speed up development.  
- **Enterprise‑ready** – Supports high‑precision modeling needed for engineering and manufacturing.
