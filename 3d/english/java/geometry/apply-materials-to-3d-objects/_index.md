# Apply Materials to 3D Objects in Java with Aspose.3D

## Introduction

In the dynamic world of 3D graphics, Aspose.3D for Java stands out as a powerful tool to bring life to your projects. Adding materials to 3D objects enhances visual appeal, making them more realistic. In this tutorial, we'll walk you through the process of applying materials to a 3D cube using Aspose.3D for Java.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the tutorial, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
- Aspose.3D for Java library downloaded and added to your project.
- Familiarity with basic Java programming concepts.

## Import Packages

To get started, import the necessary packages into your Java project. Add the following lines at the beginning of your code:

```java
import com.aspose.threed.*;


import java.nio.file.Files;
import java.nio.file.Paths;
```

## Step 1: Initialize Scene Object

```java
// Initialize scene object
Scene scene = new Scene();
```

## Step 2: Initialize Cube Node Object

```java
// Initialize cube node object
Node cubeNode = new Node("cube");
```

## Step 3: Create Mesh using Polygon Builder

```java
// Call Common class create mesh using polygon builder method to set mesh instance
Mesh mesh = Common.createMeshUsingPolygonBuilder();
```

## Step 4: Point Node to the Mesh

```java
// Point node to the mesh
cubeNode.setEntity(mesh);
```

## Step 5: Add Cube to the Scene

```java
// Add cube to the scene
scene.getRootNode().addChildNode(cubeNode);
```

## Step 6: Initialize PhongMaterial Object

```java
// Initialize PhongMaterial object
PhongMaterial mat = new PhongMaterial();
```

## Step 7: Initialize Texture Object

```java
// Initialize Texture object
Texture diffuse = new Texture();
```

## Step 8: Set Local File Path for Texture

```java
// The path to the documents directory.
String MyDir = "Your Document Directory";
```

## Step 9: Set Local File Path for Embedded Texture

```java
// Set local file path for embedded texture
diffuse.setFileName(MyDir + "surface.dds");
```

## Step 10: Set Texture of the Material

```java
// Set Texture of the material
mat.setTexture(Material.MAP_DIFFUSE, diffuse);
```

## Step 11: Embed Raw Content Data to FBX (Optional)

```java
// Set file name for embedded texture
diffuse.setFileName("embedded-texture.png");
// Set binary content
diffuse.setContent(Files.readAllBytes(Paths.get(MyDir, "aspose-logo.jpg")));
```

## Step 12: Set Specular Color

```java
// Set specular color
mat.setSpecularColor(new Vector3(1, 0, 0));
```

## Step 13: Set Brightness

```java
// Set brightness
mat.setShininess(100);
```

## Step 14: Set Material Property of the Cube Object

```java
// Set material property of the cube object
cubeNode.setMaterial(mat);
```

## Step 15: Save 3D Scene

```java
// Set the file name
MyDir = MyDir + "MaterialToCube.fbx";
// Save 3D scene in the supported file formats
scene.save(MyDir, FileFormat.FBX7400ASCII);
```

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully applied materials to a 3D cube using Aspose.3D for Java. This simple yet powerful technique can elevate your 3D projects to new heights, providing a realistic and visually stunning experience.
