# Apply PBR Materials to 3D Objects in Java with Aspose.3D

## Introduction

Welcome to this step-by-step guide on applying Physically Based Rendering (PBR) materials to 3D objects in Java using Aspose.3D. Aspose.3D is a powerful Java library that provides comprehensive functionality for working with 3D models and scenes. In this tutorial, we'll focus on applying PBR materials, which simulate real-world lighting and surface properties, enhancing the realism of your 3D objects.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the tutorial, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. Java Development Environment: Make sure you have Java installed on your system.

2. Aspose.3D Library: Download and install the Aspose.3D library from the [download link](https://releases.aspose.com/3d/java/).

3. Documentation: Refer to the [documentation](https://reference.aspose.com/3d/java/) for Aspose.3D to familiarize yourself with the library's features.

4. Temporary License (Optional): If you don't have a license, you can obtain a [temporary license](https://purchase.aspose.com/temporary-license/) for testing.

## Import Packages

In your Java project, include the necessary packages to use Aspose.3D. Add the following import statements to your code:

```java
import com.aspose.threed.*;
```

## Step 1: Initialize a Scene

Start by creating a 3D scene using Aspose.3D. The scene serves as the canvas for your 3D objects.

```java
// ExStart:InitializeScene
String MyDir = "Your Document Directory";
Scene scene = new Scene();
// ExEnd:InitializeScene
```

## Step 2: Initialize PBR Material

Create a PBR material and customize its properties such as metallic and roughness factors.

```java
// ExStart:InitializePBRMaterial
PbrMaterial mat = new PbrMaterial();
mat.setMetallicFactor(0.9);
mat.setRoughnessFactor(0.9);
// ExEnd:InitializePBRMaterial
```

## Step 3: Create a 3D Object

Generate a 3D object (e.g., a box) to which the PBR material will be applied.

```java
// ExStart:Create3DObject
Node boxNode = scene.getRootNode().createChildNode("box", new Box());
boxNode.setMaterial(mat);
// ExEnd:Create3DObject
```

## Step 4: Save the 3D Scene

Save the 3D scene, including the applied PBR material, into a specific file format, such as STL.

```java
// ExStart:Save3DScene
scene.save(MyDir + "PBR_Material_Box_Out.stl", FileFormat.STLASCII);
// ExEnd:Save3DScene
```

Repeat these steps for more complex scenes or different objects.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully applied PBR materials to a 3D object in Java using Aspose.3D. This enhances the visual appeal of your 3D models, making them more realistic and visually stunning.
