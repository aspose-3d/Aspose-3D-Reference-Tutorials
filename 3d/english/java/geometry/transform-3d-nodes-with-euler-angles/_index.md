# Transform 3D Nodes with Euler Angles in Java using Aspose.3D

## Introduction

Welcome to this step-by-step tutorial on transforming 3D nodes with Euler angles in Java using Aspose.3D. In this guide, we will delve into the process of adding transformations to a 3D node, using Euler angles to achieve dynamic positioning and orientation.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Basic knowledge of Java programming.
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine.
- Aspose.3D library, which you can obtain from [Aspose.3D Java Documentation](https://reference.aspose.com/3d/java/).

## Import Packages

Begin by importing the necessary packages into your Java project. Ensure that the Aspose.3D library is correctly added to your classpath. If you haven't downloaded it yet, you can find the download link [here](https://releases.aspose.com/3d/java/).

```java
import com.aspose.threed.*;
```

## Step 1. Initialize Scene and Node

```java
// ExStart:AddTransformationToNodeByEulerAngles
// Initialize scene object
Scene scene = new Scene();

// Initialize Node class object
Node cubeNode = new Node("cube");
```

## Step 2. Create Mesh and Set Geometry

```java
// Call Common class create mesh using polygon builder method to set mesh instance
Mesh mesh = Common.createMeshUsingPolygonBuilder();

// Point node to the Mesh geometry
cubeNode.setEntity(mesh);
```

## Step 3. Set Euler Angles and Translation

```java
// Euler angles
cubeNode.getTransform().setEulerAngles(new Vector3(0.3, 0.1, -0.5));

// Set translation
cubeNode.getTransform().setTranslation(new Vector3(0, 0, 20));
```

## Step 4. Add Node to Scene

```java
// Add cube to the scene
scene.getRootNode().getChildNodes().add(cubeNode);
```

## Step 5. Save 3D Scene

```java
// The path to the documents directory.
String MyDir = "Your Document Directory";
MyDir = MyDir + "TransformationToNode.fbx";

// Save 3D scene in the supported file formats
scene.save(MyDir, FileFormat.FBX7500ASCII);
// ExEnd:AddTransformationToNodeByEulerAngles
System.out.println("\nTransformation added successfully to node.\nFile saved at " + MyDir);
```

Make sure to replace "Your Document Directory" with the appropriate path on your machine.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully transformed 3D nodes using Euler angles in Java with Aspose.3D. Experiment with different angles and translations to create dynamic and engaging 3D scenes.
