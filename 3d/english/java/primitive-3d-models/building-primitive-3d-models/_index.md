# Building Primitive 3D Models with Aspose.3D for Java

## Introduction

Creating 3D models programmatically can be a daunting task, but with Aspose.3D for Java, it becomes an enjoyable and straightforward process. This tutorial aims to help you get started with building primitive 3D models, focusing on simplicity and effectiveness.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the world of 3D modeling with Aspose.3D for Java, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. Java Development Kit (JDK): Make sure you have JDK installed on your machine.
2. Aspose.3D for Java Library: Download and install the Aspose.3D for Java library from the [download page](https://releases.aspose.com/3d/java/).

## Import Packages

Begin by importing the necessary packages into your Java project. This step is crucial for accessing the functionalities provided by Aspose.3D for Java.

```java

import com.aspose.threed.*;
```

Now that you have everything set up, let's move on to the core of this tutorial â€“ building primitive 3D models.

## Creating a Scene

### Step 1: Initialize a Scene Object

```java
// The path to the documents directory.
String myDir = "Your Document Directory";

// Initialize a Scene object
Scene scene = new Scene();
```

### Step 2: Create a Box Model

```java
// Create a Box model
scene.getRootNode().createChildNode("box", new Box());
```

### Step 3: Create a Cylinder Model

```java
// Create a Cylinder model
scene.getRootNode().createChildNode("cylinder", new Cylinder());
```

### Step 4: Save Drawing in the FBX Format

```java
// Save drawing in the FBX format
myDir = myDir + "test.fbx";
scene.save(myDir, FileFormat.FBX7500ASCII);
```

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully built a scene from primitive 3D models using Aspose.3D for Java. The file is now saved at the specified directory.
