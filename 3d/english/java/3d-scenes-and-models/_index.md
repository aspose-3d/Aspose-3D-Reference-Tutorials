- **Do I need a license?** A free trial is available; a commercial license is required for production use.  
- **What Java version is supported?** Java 8 and newer.  
- **Is compression safe?** Yes – Aspose 3D Java uses lossless compression to keep geometry intact.

## What is “create 3d scene java”?

Creating a 3D scene in Java means programmatically defining cameras, lights, meshes, and materials, then exporting the scene to a format such as OBJ, FBX, or STL. Aspose 3D Java provides a fluent API that abstracts the low‑level details, allowing you to focus on the visual outcome rather than file‑format intricacies.

## Why use Aspose 3D Java for 3D scene creation?

- **Full‑featured API** – supports dozens of 3D formats out of the box.  
- **Performance‑optimized** – handles large meshes and complex hierarchies efficiently.  
- **Cross‑platform** – works on any JVM‑compatible environment.  
- **Rich documentation & samples** – accelerate development with ready‑made tutorials.

## How to get started

1. **Add the Aspose 3D Java dependency** to your Maven or Gradle project.  
2. **Instantiate the `Scene` object** and start adding geometry, cameras, and lights.  
3. **Save the scene** using the desired format (e.g., `scene.save("model.obj")`).  
4. **Optional:** Apply compression or custom mesh formats as shown in the linked tutorials.

Below is a curated list of step‑by‑step tutorials that dive deeper into each of these stages.
