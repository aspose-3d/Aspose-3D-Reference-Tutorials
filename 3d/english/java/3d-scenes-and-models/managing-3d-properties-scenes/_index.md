# Work with 3D Properties and Custom Data in Java Scenes Using Aspose.3D

## Introduction

Welcome to the comprehensive guide on working with 3D properties and custom data in Java scenes using Aspose.3D. In this tutorial, we will delve into the powerful features of Aspose.3D, providing step-by-step guidance on manipulating 3D properties within your Java applications.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine.
- Aspose.3D library downloaded and set up. You can download it from the [Aspose website](https://releases.aspose.com/3d/java/).
- A basic understanding of Java programming.

## Import Packages

Ensure that you import the necessary packages to leverage the functionalities provided by Aspose.3D in your Java code. Include the following:

```java
import java.io.IOException;

import com.aspose.threed.Material;
import com.aspose.threed.Property;
import com.aspose.threed.PropertyCollection;
import com.aspose.threed.Scene;
import com.aspose.threed.Vector3;
```

Now, let's break down the provided example into multiple steps for a clear and detailed understanding.

## Step 1: Initialize the Scene

```java
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
Scene scene = new Scene(dataDir + "EmbeddedTexture.fbx");
```

In this step, we initialize a 3D scene using the Aspose.3D library, loading a 3D model from the specified directory.

## Step 2: Access Material Properties

```java
Material material = scene.getRootNode().getChildNodes().get(0).getMaterial();
PropertyCollection props = material.getProperties();
```

Here, we retrieve the material properties of the 3D model, allowing us to manipulate various aspects such as color, texture, and more.

## Step 3: List All Properties

```java
for (Property prop : props) {
    System.out.println("Name" + prop.getName() + " Value = " + prop.getValue());
}
```

Iterate through all the properties using a for loop, printing their names and values. This provides a comprehensive overview of the available properties.

## Step 4: Modify Property Value

```java
props.set("Diffuse", new Vector3(1, 0, 1));
```

In this step, we modify the value of a specific property ("Diffuse") to alter the appearance of the 3D model.

## Step 5: Retrieve Property by Name

```java
Object diffuse = (Vector3) props.get("Diffuse");
System.out.println(diffuse);
```

Retrieve the value of a specific property ("Diffuse") by its name and print the result.

## Step 6: Access Property Instance

```java
Property pdiffuse = props.findProperty("Diffuse");
System.out.println(pdiffuse);
```

Get an instance of a property ("Diffuse") and print information about it, including its type and label.

## Step 7: Traverse Property's Properties

```java
for (Property pp : pdiffuse.getProperties()) {
    System.out.println("Diffuse. " + pp.getName() + " = " + pp.getValue());
}
```

Traverse through the properties of the "Diffuse" property, demonstrating the ability to navigate through hierarchical property structures.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have successfully learned how to work with 3D properties and custom data in Java scenes using Aspose.3D. This tutorial covered essential steps, allowing you to manipulate various aspects of 3D models within your Java applications.
