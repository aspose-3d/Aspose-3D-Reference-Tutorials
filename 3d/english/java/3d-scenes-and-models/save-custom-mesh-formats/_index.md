# Save 3D Meshes in Custom Binary Formats for Flexibility in Java

## Introduction

Welcome to this step-by-step tutorial on saving 3D meshes in custom binary formats for flexibility in Java using Aspose.3D. In this guide, we'll walk you through the process of converting 3D meshes and saving them in a custom binary format to enhance flexibility and interoperability in your Java applications.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. Java Environment: Ensure that you have a Java development environment set up on your system.

2. Aspose.3D for Java: Download and install the Aspose.3D library for Java. You can find the library [here](https://releases.aspose.com/3d/java/).

3. 3D Model File: Have a 3D model file (e.g., "test.fbx") that you want to process using Aspose.3D.

## Import Packages

In your Java project, import the necessary packages for working with Aspose.3D:

```java
import com.aspose.threed.*;


import java.io.*;
import java.util.List;
```

## Step 1: Load the 3D Model

```java
Scene scene = new Scene("Your Document Directory" + "test.fbx");
```

## Step 2: Define the Custom Binary Format

Before saving the 3D meshes, define the structure of your custom binary format. The example demonstrates a simple structure:

```java
// Struct definitions for the custom binary format
// ...
```

## Step 3: Save 3D Meshes in Custom Binary Format

```java
try (DataOutputStream writer = new DataOutputStream(new BufferedOutputStream(new FileOutputStream("Your Document Directory" + "Save3DMeshesInCustomBinaryFormat_out")))) {
    // Visit each descent node in the scene
    scene.getRootNode().accept(new NodeVisitor() {
        @Override
        public boolean call(Node node) {
            try {
                for (Entity entity : node.getEntities()) {
                    if (!(entity instanceof IMeshConvertible))
                        continue;
                    // Convert entity to mesh
                    Mesh m = ((IMeshConvertible) entity).toMesh();
                    // Get control points and triangulate the mesh
                    List<Vector4> controlPoints = m.getControlPoints();
                    int[][] triFaces = PolygonModifier.triangulate(controlPoints, m.getPolygons());
                    // Get global transform matrix
                    Matrix4 transform = node.getGlobalTransform().getTransformMatrix();

                    // Write number of control points and triangle indices
                    writer.writeInt(controlPoints.size());
                    writer.writeInt(triFaces.length);
                    // Write control points
                    for (int i = 0; i < controlPoints.size(); i++) {
                        Vector4 cp = Matrix4.mul(transform, controlPoints.get(i));
                        // Save control points to file
                        writer.writeFloat((float) cp.x);
                        writer.writeFloat((float) cp.y);
                        writer.writeFloat((float) cp.z);
                    }
                    // Write triangle indices
                    for (int i = 0; i < triFaces.length; i++) {
                        writer.writeInt(triFaces[i][0]);
                        writer.writeInt(triFaces[i][1]);
                        writer.writeInt(triFaces[i][2]);
                    }
                }
            } catch (Exception e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
            return true;
        }
    });
} catch (IOException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```

This code snippet demonstrates how to traverse the 3D model, convert meshes, and save them in a custom binary format.
