## Introduction

Are you ready to elevate your 3D modeling experience with Aspose.3D for Java? This tutorial will guide you through the process of creating customized fan cylinders using the powerful Aspose.3D library. Whether you're a seasoned developer or a beginner, this step-by-step guide will help you unleash the full potential of Aspose.3D in Java.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the tutorial, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Java Development Kit (JDK): Make sure you have JDK installed on your system. You can download it [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).

- Aspose.3D for Java: Download and install the Aspose.3D library for Java from the [download link](https://releases.aspose.com/3d/java/).

## Import Packages

Begin by importing the necessary packages into your Java project. This step is crucial for accessing the functionalities provided by Aspose.3D.

```java
import com.aspose.threed.*;


import java.io.IOException;
```

## Step 1: Create a Scene

Start by initializing a 3D scene using the following code snippet:

```java
// ExStart:2
// Create a Scene
Scene scene = new Scene();
// ExEnd:2
```

This sets the stage for your 3D modeling adventure.

## Step 2: Create a Fan Cylinder

Now, let's create a fan cylinder using the Aspose.3D library:

```java
// ExStart:3
// Create a cylinder with fan
Cylinder fan = new Cylinder(2, 2, 10, 20, 1, false);
fan.setGenerateFanCylinder(true);
fan.setThetaLength(MathUtils.toRadian(270.0));
// ExEnd:3
```

This snippet sets the dimensions of the cylinder, enables fan generation, and specifies the theta length.

## Step 3: Position the Fan Cylinder

Place the fan cylinder within the 3D scene by adding it as a child node and setting its translation:

```java
// ExStart:4
// Create ChildNode and set translation
scene.getRootNode().createChildNode(fan).getTransform().setTranslation(10, 0, 0);
// ExEnd:4
```

This positions the fan cylinder at coordinates (10, 0, 0) within the scene.

## Step 4: Create a Non-Fan Cylinder

Let's also create a non-fan cylinder to showcase the flexibility of Aspose.3D:

```java
// ExStart:5
// Create a cylinder without a fan
Cylinder nonfan = new Cylinder(2, 2, 10, 20, 1, false);
// Create ChildNode
scene.getRootNode().createChildNode(nonfan);
// ExEnd:5
```

This snippet generates a cylinder without a fan and adds it to the scene.

## Step 5: Save the Scene

Finally, save the scene as a Wavefront OBJ file in your document directory:

```java
// ExStart:6
// Save scene
scene.save("Your Document Directory" + "CreateFanCylinder.obj", FileFormat.WAVEFRONTOBJ);
// ExEnd:6
```

Congratulations! You've successfully created customized fan cylinders using Aspose.3D for Java.
