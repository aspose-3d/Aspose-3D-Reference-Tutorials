# Creating Cylinders with Sheared Bottom in Aspose.3D for Java

## Introduction

Welcome to this step-by-step guide on creating cylinders with sheared bottoms using Aspose.3D for Java. Aspose.3D is a powerful Java library that allows you to work with 3D files effortlessly. In this tutorial, we'll dive into creating customized cylinders with sheared bottoms, providing you with a hands-on experience in using Aspose.3D to enhance your 3D modeling skills.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
- Aspose.3D for Java library downloaded and added to your project. You can find the download link [here](https://releases.aspose.com/3d/java/).

## Import Packages

To start, import the necessary packages for working with Aspose.3D in your Java application:
```java
import com.aspose.threed.*;


import java.io.IOException;
```

## Step 1: Create a Scene

Begin by creating a 3D scene where you'll add and manipulate your cylinders:
```java
// ExStart:3
// Create a scene
Scene scene = new Scene();
// ExEnd:3
```

## Step 2: Create Cylinder 1

Now, let's create the first cylinder with a sheared bottom:
```java
// ExStart:4
// Create cylinder 1
Cylinder cylinder1 = new Cylinder(2, 2, 10, 20, 1, false);
// Customized shear bottom for cylinder 1
cylinder1.setShearBottom(new Vector2(0, 0.83)); // Shear 47.5deg in the xy plane (z-axis)
// Add cylinder 1 to the scene
scene.getRootNode().createChildNode(cylinder1).getTransform().setTranslation(10, 0, 0);
// ExEnd:4
```

## Step 3: Create Cylinder 2

Next, let's add a second cylinder without a sheared bottom to the scene:
```java
// ExStart:5
// Create cylinder 2
Cylinder cylinder2 = new Cylinder(2, 2, 10, 20, 1, false);
// Add cylinder 2 without a ShearBottom to the scene
scene.getRootNode().createChildNode(cylinder2);
// ExEnd:5
```

## Step 4: Save the Scene

Save the scene with the customized cylinders to your document directory:
```java
// ExStart:6
// Save scene
scene.save("Your Document Directory" + "CustomizedShearBottomCylinder.obj", FileFormat.WAVEFRONTOBJ);
// ExEnd:6
```

Congratulations! You've successfully created cylinders with sheared bottoms using Aspose.3D for Java.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we explored how to leverage Aspose.3D for Java to enhance your 3D modeling projects. Creating customized cylinders with sheared bottoms adds a unique touch to your designs, and Aspose.3D simplifies the process.
