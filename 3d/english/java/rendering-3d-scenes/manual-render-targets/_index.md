# Manually Control Render Targets for Customized Rendering in Java 3D

## Introduction

Are you ready to elevate your Java 3D graphics to the next level? Aspose.3D for Java is your gateway to unlocking the full potential of customized rendering. In this tutorial, we'll delve into the intricacies of manually controlling render targets, giving you the tools to create visually captivating scenes tailored to your specifications.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- A working knowledge of Java programming.
- Aspose.3D for Java library installed. You can download it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/3d/java/).
- Basic understanding of Java 3D graphics concepts.

## Import Packages

To get started, import the necessary packages into your Java project:

```java
import com.aspose.threed.*;


import javax.imageio.ImageIO;
import java.awt.*;
import java.awt.image.BufferedImage;
import java.io.File;
import java.io.IOException;
```

## Step 1: Setup the Scene

Begin by creating a scene and setting up the camera for rendering:

```java
Scene scene = new Scene();
Camera camera = setupScene(scene);
```

## Step 2: Define Output Image

Specify the output image file where the rendered scene will be saved:

```java
String output = "manual-render-to-image.png";
```

## Step 3: Create BufferedImage

Create a `BufferedImage` with the desired dimensions and type for rendering:

```java
BufferedImage image = new BufferedImage(1024, 1024, BufferedImage.TYPE_3BYTE_BGR);
```

## Step 4: Render Scene to Image

Render the scene to the created image:

```java
scene.render(camera, image);
```

## Step 5: Manually Control Render Targets

Now, let's dive into the heart of customization. Use Aspose.3D to manually control render targets:

```java
try (Renderer renderer = Renderer.createRenderer()) {
    try (IRenderTexture rt = renderer.getRenderFactory().createRenderTexture(new RenderParameters(), 1, image.getWidth(), image.getHeight())) {
        rt.createViewport(camera, Color.pink, RelativeRectangle.fromScale(0, 0, 1, 1));
        renderer.render(rt);
        ITexture2D texture = (ITexture2D) rt.getTargets().get(0);
        texture.save(image);
    }
}
```

## Step 6: Save Rendered Image

Save the final rendered image to the specified output file:

```java
ImageIO.write(image, "png", new File(output));
```

Congratulations! You've successfully learned how to manually control render targets for customized rendering in Java 3D using Aspose.3D. Experiment with different parameters and unleash your creativity to craft visually stunning graphics.
