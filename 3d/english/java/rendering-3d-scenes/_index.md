## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What is the difference between manual render targets and the default pipeline?**  
A: Manual render targets let you specify custom buffers, formats, and resolutions, giving you pixel‑perfect control over the output.

**Q: Can I render directly to a PNG file without an intermediate buffer?**  
A: Yes—Aspose.3D provides a one‑step “render to image” API that writes PNG, JPEG, or BMP files directly.

**Q: Is real‑time 3D rendering limited to SWT?**  
A: While SWT is a popular choice for desktop UI, the engine can also be embedded in JavaFX or custom OpenGL windows.

**Q: How do I integrate basic 3d rendering into an existing Java project?**  
A: Add the Aspose.3D Maven/Gradle dependency, import the relevant classes, and follow the “Basic Rendering Techniques” tutorial to get started.

**Q: Are there performance tips for rendering large scenes?**  
A: Use frustum culling, level‑of‑detail meshes, and render to lower‑resolution targets when possible to keep frame rates high.
