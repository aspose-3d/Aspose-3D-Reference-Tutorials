# Upgrade 3D Materials to PBR for Enhanced Realism in Java with Aspose.3D

## Introduction

Upgrading your 3D materials to PBR is a transformative step towards achieving lifelike visuals in your Java applications. Aspose.3D simplifies this process, allowing you to seamlessly transition from traditional materials to PBR materials. In this tutorial, we'll explore the necessary prerequisites, import packages, and break down each example into detailed steps.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the tutorial, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

1. Aspose.3D for Java: Download and install the Aspose.3D library from the [release page](https://releases.aspose.com/3d/java/).

2. Java Development Environment: Make sure you have a Java development environment set up on your machine.

3. Document Directory: Create a dedicated directory for your 3D documents.

## Import Packages

To begin the upgrade process, import the required packages into your Java project. Use the following code snippet as a guide:

```java
import com.aspose.threed.*;
```

Ensure that you include all the necessary Aspose.3D packages to leverage its functionalities seamlessly.

## Step 1: Initialize a New 3D Scene

Begin by initializing a new 3D scene using the following code:

```java
// ExStart:InitializeScene
String MyDir = "Your Document Directory";
Scene s = new Scene();
// ExEnd:InitializeScene
```

## Step 2: Create a Box with PhongMaterial

Create a 3D box and assign a PhongMaterial to it:

```java
// ExStart:CreateBoxWithMaterial
Box box = new Box();
PhongMaterial mat = new PhongMaterial();
mat.setDiffuseColor(new Vector3(1, 0, 1));
s.getRootNode().createChildNode("box1", box).setMaterial(mat);
// ExEnd:CreateBoxWithMaterial
```

## Step 3: Save in GLTF 2.0 Format

Save the scene in GLTF 2.0 format, converting PhongMaterial to PBRMaterial during the process:

```java
// ExStart:SaveInGLTF
GltfSaveOptions opt = new GltfSaveOptions(FileFormat.GLTF2);
opt.setMaterialConverter(new MaterialConverter() {
    @Override
    public Material call(Material material) {
        PhongMaterial m = (PhongMaterial) material;
        PbrMaterial ret = new PbrMaterial();
        ret.setAlbedo(m.getDiffuseColor());
        return ret;
    }
});
s.save(MyDir + "Non_PBRtoPBRMaterial_Out.gltf", opt);
// ExEnd:SaveInGLTF
```

Follow these steps meticulously to seamlessly upgrade your 3D materials to PBR, enhancing realism in Java applications.
