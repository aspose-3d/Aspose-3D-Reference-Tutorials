## What is export point cloud PLY?
Exporting a point cloud to the PLY format means converting a collection of 3D points (with optional color, normal, or texture data) into a file that can be read by most 3D viewers, editors, and analysis tools. This format preserves the spatial accuracy of your data while keeping the file lightweight.

## Why create point cloud mesh?
Creating a point cloud from an existing mesh (or vice‑versa) gives you flexibility in how you visualize, process, or transmit 3D data. A **create point cloud mesh** workflow is especially useful when you need to:

- Reduce file size for web or mobile delivery.
- Perform point‑based analysis such as surface reconstruction.
- Integrate with GIS or LiDAR pipelines that expect raw point data.
