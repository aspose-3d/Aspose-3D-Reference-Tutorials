## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I use Aspose.3D for commercial Java applications?**  
A: Yes. A commercial license removes all evaluation limitations and grants full deployment rights.

**Q: Which file formats does Aspose.3D support for import/export?**  
A: OBJ, STL, FBX, GLTF/GLB, 3MF, PLY, VRML, and more. The library also supports converting between these formats.

**Q: How do I enable hardware‑accelerated rendering?**  
A: Aspose.3D handles rendering internally; for real‑time GPU acceleration you can export to a format compatible with external engines (e.g., GLTF) and render with OpenGL/DirectX.

**Q: What is the best way to reduce mesh size for web delivery?**  
A: Use the Draco compression utilities provided in the “Optimizing and Working with 3D Mesh Data” tutorial to compress meshes without visual loss.

**Q: Are there examples for animating cameras along a spline path?**  
A: Yes. The “Working with Animations in Java” tutorial includes a full example of key‑frame camera animation.
